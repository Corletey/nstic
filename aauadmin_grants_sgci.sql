Therefore, I find the first question entirely divergent: â€œIs Sierra Leonean homegrown rice nutritionally superior to imported rice?â€ It appears to be an attempt to introduce wet chemistry or natural science into a project designed to be predominantly a training exercise or qualitative research. Without admitting that the question is relevant, could environment, genotype, and processing impact the results of this part of the project? How would these be accounted for, and what happens if the foreign varieties are more nutritious than the local ones? \r\nThe argument about pursuing homegrown rice appears to be based solely on nutritional composition, which could be problematic. Advocating for enhancing local food crops or rice production in a developing nation like Sierra Leone should involve a nuanced argument considering both nutritional and economic dimensions. Of course, emphasizing the nutritional composition of homegrown foods underscores the importance of providing the population with healthier dietary options addressing health and food security concerns. Local production ensures fresher and more nutrient-rich alternatives and mitigates the risks associated with global supply chain disruptions. \r\nHowever, there could be even stronger arguments not based on nutritional composition. On the economic front, prioritizing local agriculture contributes significantly to job creation, poverty reduction, and overall GDP growth. The employment opportunities generated across the agricultural supply chain and reduced dependence on costly imports lead to sustainable economic development. Moreover, fostering local production is a strategic approach to improving the nationâ€™s trade balance, promoting economic self-sufficiency, and creating a resilient and diversified economy. Therefore, the argument for advancing local food production intertwines health, economic prosperity, and long-term sustainability to benefit the nationâ€™s populace.

Indeed, integrating automated milling and packaging equipment represents a significant leap towards modernization, promising increased efficiency and productivity. Solar drying and cold storage facilities are committed to sustainable practices, addressing postharvest losses and extending product shelf life. Eco-friendly packaging and energy-efficient solutions underscore a dedication to environmental responsibility, aligning with global trends in consumer preferences. Moreover, emphasizing adherence to international quality and environmental standards positions local rice products for competitiveness in the global market, and the inclusion of capacity-building initiatives ensures a sustainable impact by enhancing the skills and knowledge of stakeholders. \r\nAll these should ordinarily contribute to the novelty of the project. Still, I see a dichotomy between what the project intends to do and the narration of the originality or novelty statement. I have read the background and methodology and submitted the budget several times. I cannot see where automated milling and packaging equipment, solar drying, cold storage facilities, eco-friendly packaging, and energy-efficient solutions have been mentioned. The methods section does not elaborate on how this equipment will be leveraged in the project, and the budget sure does not hint at their procurement.

This proposal could fit under that theme. Even so, I took the liberty to read the National Rice Development Strategy (NRDS) of Sierra Leone prepared for the Coalition for African Rice Development (CARD) in 2009. It states that in Sierra Leone, â€œwhile climatic conditions are generally favourable for crop production including rice, biotic and abiotic factors such as diseases, pests, low soil fertility, in addition to the use of low yielding local varieties, poor extension services, and several socioeconomic factors are considered to be limiting farmersâ€™ productivity. Also, most smallholder farmersâ€™ yields are significantly reduced by postharvest losses due to poor crop management and inappropriate storage and marketing facilities.â€ Accordingly, â€œthe goal of the National Rice Development Strategy (NRDS) is to lay out a framework for significant increases in rice production Sierra Leoneâ€. Specifically, the NRDS wishes to increase riceâ€™s sustainable productivity and production in Sierra Leone and promote appropriate postharvest handling, processing, and marketing of rice, among other things. \r\nThis suggests that strengthening the rice value chain in Sierra Leone requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of the production, processing, and marketing stages. Conducting impactful research in agronomic practices and crop improvement is vital. While postharvest handling and storage are important research areas for the rice value chain in Sierra Leone, research efforts targeting agronomic practices and crop improvement will be fundamental. Of course, improved postharvest handling, storage, and processing techniques are crucial for minimizing losses and maintaining the quality of rice. Implementing proper storage facilities and reducing postharvest losses contribute to the overall efficiency of the value chain, but if the produce is not adequately produced, what would be processed? Research on optimizing agronomic practices, including crop varieties, irrigation techniques, and pest management, can enhance rice yields and quality, increasing farmersâ€™ productivity and strengthening the foundational stage of the value chain. So, I think that the lack of focus on the foundational stage of the rice value chain, enhancing productivity, is a significant limitation of this project, especially when the applicants admitted that research results from 2022 showed â€œlow rice crop yieldsâ€ in the country. Thus, it is essential to improve yields and processing concurrently. \r\n', 'Indeed, the proposal responds largely to the \"Promoting the development of agro-processing and preservation industries\" goal of the call.

The proposalâ€™s slight innovation possibly lies in combining scientific research with community-based solutions, emphasizing indigenous vegetablesâ€™ unique attributes and proposing sustainable interventions. \r\nThe applicants noted that some â€œindigenous vegetables have been identified as edible with high potential of nutritive values, but they are in most cases completely neglected and underutilized putting them under the category of crops called Neglected and underutilized speciesâ€. The begging question is why are these crops neglected and underutilized? Finding this answer will be critical to finding a solution or improving the status of these crops. Several factors contribute to the underutilization or neglect of certain crops, and these reasons can vary across different regions and communities. The underutilization or neglect of certain crops can be attributed to many factors. Market dynamics play a crucial role, with crops experiencing low demand or less favorability among consumers often being overlooked. Limited awareness and knowledge about specific cropsâ€™ nutritional or economic potential contribute to their neglect, as farmers may opt for more familiar alternatives. Inadequate infrastructure, including poor transportation and storage facilities, hinders the market access and distribution of certain crops, leading farmers to focus on those with established supply chains. Despite their potential adaptability to local conditions, research and development priorities that favour high-yielding and widely consumed crops may sideline indigenous or traditional varieties.\r\nAdditionally, government policies, climate variations, and global dietary trends can further influence the cultivation choices made by farmers, perpetuating the underutilization of crops that could otherwise offer unique benefits. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive efforts in research, education, market development, policy support, and infrastructure improvement to enhance the overall recognition and value of underutilized crops. \r\nThus, the solution might not be one-size-fits-all. Critical analyses of the value chain of each indigenous crop are needed to identify the precise constraint, and until that is done, fashioning out a solution might misfire. Unfortunately, this proposal assumes that the neglect of the Sierral Lonnean indigenous crops is solely due to the limited awareness and knowledge about the nutritional potential of all the crops. Such an assumption is problematic and pervasive in this type of work. This work would have been more innovative if it had departed from the trend. \r\n', ' The proposal presents a comprehensive approach to addressing the householdâ€™s malnutrition, poverty, and food insecurity.

In my academic role at the University of Sierra Leone, I supervise undergraduate dissertation work, teach students and conduct research that focus primarily on AMR and HIV. To this end,Â I received several trainings on operational research, including the World Health Organization Structured Operational Research Initiative on combating AMR (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNwV3asNUTE) and the Pan African Thoracic Society Methods in Epidemiologic, Clinical and Operations Research. I provide mentorship to medical students on research (https://issuu.com/slemsasl/docs/score_research). This development has led me to be part of several research networks. Iâ€™m a member of the International COVID-19 Research Network, a team member of the African Research Collaboration on Sepsis (https://www.arcsepsis.com/sierra-leone) and one of the Sierra Leone representatives to the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership Association (https://www.edctp.org/news/sierra-leone-joins-edctp-association/#).

There is a wide gap between potential and actual yield of major crops due to soil acidity and associated low nutrient reserves. Every year, farmers receive fertilizers from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) to boost their soil nutrient reserve. While this is good, it should be noted that acidic soils are unresponsive to applied inorganic fertilizers and without amendments, such effort leads to wastage of resources. Hence, developing effective and efficient acid soil management practices that area suitable for Sierra Leone situation is indispensable for enhancing crop productivity and sustainable yield. This project seeks to characterize soil acidity, diagnose nutrient deficiencies, design and test innovative cost-effective soil acidity management technologies to improve crop productivity, and soil health and fertility. \r\nThe project is designed to generate both qualitative and quantitative data on soil health and fertility using conventional as well as remote sensing and GIS techniques. Prior to field work, desk survey and GIS work will commence followed by a reconnaissance survey. Soil samples will be will be collected and analysed, and the results will be interpreted to provide guidelines for crop adaptation to acid soil conditions in Sierra Leone.  \r\nThe experiment will be conducted in two phases; namely, a greenhouse phase that would involve pot experiment and a field phase that would be designed and managed by the project technical staffs and MSc student. Soil samples will be collected at both phases and analyzed for soil acidity, Al toxicity, and nutrient status. Agronomic data will be correlated with soil data to evaluate the impact of soil acidity on nutrient availability and crop growth.', 'Research on soil acidity and its control has been going on in Sierra Leone for several years, but at a very low scale. Odell et al (1974) first reported the presence of strongly acidic soils with pH in top soils ranging from 3.03 to 5.30 with a mean of about 4.58 and exchangeable aluminium between 0.31-6.27cmol kg-1 of soil with a mean of 2.01 cmol kg-1. Rhodes (1984) underscored the importance of exchangeable Al in soil acidity within the pH range of 4 to 5, noting that exchangeable Al was the dominant component of 1M KCl exchangeable acidity (Al+H) in top and subsoils of the Momenga series in the Njala University area of Sierra Leone. National figures reported for yield indicate a wide gap between potential and actual yield due to soil acidity and associated low nutrient reserves. Limited trials have been conducted at various locations, aimed at raising soil pH and ameliorating the negative effects of soil acidity using imported calcium carbonate, basic slag and locally available ground oyster shell. Lime application rates between 0.5 to 4.0 tons ha-1 proved effective to reduce aluminum saturation and raise soil pH to 5.5. However, the need for cost benefit analysis of liming materials remains indispensable. \r\nTo counter the low crop yields, MAFS has promoted the use of NPK fertilizers among farmers for decades through fertilizer subsidies, although its adoption on a national scale is still very low. At present, correction of soil acidity by liming is not popular among small-scale farmers, but few commercial agro-investors are doing so for high value crops like sugar cane and turmeric. Hence, a good soil fertility management involving the management of soil acidity and nutrient supply is crucial for boosting agricultural productivity on sustainable basis. On this note, this project is proposed to characterize soil acidity, assess soil fertility, design and test innovative cost-effective soil acidity management technologies to improve soil health and fertility, and crop productivity. The project will map soil acidity, identify nutrient deficiencies, evaluate the impact of soil acidity on nutrient availability, identify best management practices for soil acidity, and enhance the capacity of farmers and subject matter specialists in MAFS to address soil acidity related problems. This will enable farmers to understand soil pH variability across their lands, identify acid soils and assess the best ways to treat them. ', 'Various stakeholders including farmers, scientists, administrators, researchers and policy planners and decision makers are involved in various agricultural development programmes related to soil but do not have access to adequate and easily retrievable digital information on soil resources that can be easily accessed, processed and visualized. Previous soil survey reports were produced in formats that are not user-friendly and hence cannot be easily accessed by intended users. Generating digital information on the spatial distribution of soil resources will cater for the demands of various stakeholders dealing with soil-related resources in various agricultural development programmes. This will strengthen existing innovation systems at multidisciplinary levels and foster the adoption of agri-based digital technologies in Sierra Leone in particular and West Africa as a whole. When soil information is in digital format, it makes it easier and more efficient for its intended users including farmers, agro-industrial companies and small business enterprises to access such information and use it to make better informed decisions that would enhance crop production. The creation of a digital soil database is an agri-based digital innovation that enhances efficient and profitable farming and judicious land use planning and improvement in soil productivity and farm yield through dissemination and increased utilization of soil resource information by the farming communities. The above relevance of the project fits well into the strategic and global objectives agricultural development.', 'Previous soil surveys in Sierra Leone have used conventional/traditional methods for mapping soil resources. For example, between 1975 and 1979, the Land Resources Survey Project (LRSP) in MAF, which was funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and jointly executed by MAF and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), conducted a nationwide reconnaissance survey, characterization, and suitability evaluation of the natural biophysical resources (including soils, landforms, vegetation, and land use) for agricultural development purposes in Sierra Leone. These soil surveys were extremely tedious, time-consuming, and involved extensive traversing in field. In such survey exercises, the soil surveyors visited the communities where they inquired about soils from farmers, who were mostly illiterates. This methodology was not only limited by lack of accuracy but it was also time-consuming, expensive and had low repetitive value. In addition, the reports of such soil surveys were produced in formats that are not user-friendly. In many cases, these reports ended up in shelves without being accessed by target beneficiaries. Considering the need for timely availability of user-friendly information on soil resources of any geographical area, it is of essence to assess and map soil resources and make these information available on time to the relevant stakeholders in the agriculture and related sectors for various policy planning and decision making purposes. The uniqueness of this project is that it will use geospatial technology involving the use of remote sensing GIS and GPS techniques to generate detailed spatial information on soil resources of the target areas. This approach is more cost effective, accurate and reliable, timely and faster than conventional ground-based surveys. Geospatial techniques are digital innovations that have rapidly evolved over the years and have proven to be very efficient and effective in assessing and mapping natural resources in many parts of the world. Through these technologies, ', 'Soil acidity is a topical problem in Sierra Leone, accounting for about 75% of the total arable land area and is widely distributed across the five main agroecologies causing about 50% yield loss (SSL, 2017). Soils of Sierra Leone are generally low activity clay soils, highly weathered and acidic Ultisols and Oxisols (Odell et al. 1974, Sutton et al., 1989), low in available nutrients and crop yields. These soils are quite strongly acidic having exchangeable aluminium dominating the exchange complex with values of 2-6 cmol kg-1 and pH in water of less than 4.8 not being uncommon. This high level of soil acidity negatively influences the availability and uptake of nutrients in the soil, microbial population and activities and consequently crop growth and yields. The prevalent high rainfall regime and low cation retention capacity, favour high leaching losses of basic cations (nutrients) and development of soil acidity. \r\nResearch on soil acidity and its control has been going on in Sierra Leone for several years, but at a very low scale.

While these innovations have been rolled out in several West African countries, Sierra Leone has not fully grasped this advantage. This ', 'In 2018, MAFS under the popular â€œNew Direction Governmentâ€ developed a five-year agricultural master plan called the â€œNational Agricultural Transformation Plan 2019-2023â€, which emphasizes on the management of natural resources, site-specific management for fertilizer applications, management of soil acidity, increased production and productivity of the priority crops. As a part of the core activities within this plan, MAFS is in this context planning a wide scale liming programme. The development of the agriculture sector from the current level of low production and productivity of food and tree cash crops, in transition from a system of bush fallow rotation in the uplands to diversified sustainable commercial farming demands the use of environmentally sound soil resource management strategies such as the use of soil amendments to control the problems soil acidity in Sierra Leone. However, there is lack of adequate information on the current status of soil acidity that could inform such national drive. Therefore, conducting a study of this nature to assess the current status of soil acidity would therefore contribute to this vision and plan. The results of this project will inform and strengthen MAFSâ€™s plan on sustainable soil resource inventory and modeling of agricultural production and productivity, land use planning and soil management at national, regional and district levels and site selection for agricultural project implementation. ETU-SL and other research institutions such as Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI) and Njala University will use the information as basis for locating on-farm trials such as calibrating soil tests with crop responses to nutrient sources and enhancing their soil testing-fertilizer advisory services to farmers; better fertilizer distribution by MAFS and use, as well as improving on fertilizer use efficiency in the country.

The current palm fruit harvesting method is performed in a dangerous manner where workers either climb the trees with axe, cutlass or they use an elongated pole with metal attached to the end in order to remove the fruit. In such method many Sierra Leoneans have died in using the traditional method of harvesting oil palm. Both of these methods are extremely dangerous because the palm fruit bunch could strike the workers on the ground and cause injury or the worker could injure themselves by climbing a tree with a blade in hand. The goal of this research is to create a mechanism that will replace these dangerous methods and improve the previous mechanisms.

It has an estimated 56.17% of the population living in rural areas (World Bank, 2023). Agriculture is the most significant sector in the economy of Sierra Leone, contributing to about 57.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and employing about 65â€“70% of the population (SSL, 2022), thus making agricultural development not only important in its own right but also having positive implications for the development of other sectors of the economy. Though the sector is characterized by food production involving mostly smallholder farming for subsistence with land holding size of about 0.5â€“2 ha, there are opportunities such as adequate arable land, abundant water resources, favourable climate, hard-working farmers and encouraging government and donor partner support. However, the greatest challenge throughout history is for the country to feed its ever-increasing population on a permanent basis. On the side of the government, several initiatives and interventions have been pursued over the years but the yield still continues to be appalling. From the research level, several technologies have been developed by research and extension organizations to increase productivity of crop production systems in the subregion. However, the adoption of technologies to increase agricultural productivity has been extremely low and there remains very little utilization of modern varieties, agronomic improvements, inputs such as fertilizer and mechanization (e.g. planters and weeders) in Sierra Leone.

Improved agronomic practices (optimal crop densities, combinations, arrangements, and rotations; beneficial nutrient management practices; effective pest management techniques; efficient water management including drip irrigation) \r\n3.	Micro dosing of fertilizers (direct application to plants) and use of mechanized sowing, weeding, locally produced harvesting and threshing equipment. The motorized seeder reduces seeding labor time from 12 person days/ha (manual) or 1 person day/ha (animal traction) to 0.25 person day/ha. \r\n\r\n', 'The result is that available policy options have been limited. Extension agricultural services to enhance the effective use of inputs and post-harvest technology applications have had low coverage. These challenges have resulted in limited improvement in agricultural productivity and a dependence on the importation of rice, along with low production volumes of food and cash crops and insufficient livestock management.', 'The proposed project will introduce and promote climate smart agricultural technologies and innovations to improve rural livelihoods and food security. These technologies relate to crop varieties and crop management practices. Multi-stakeholder platforms will bring together key value chain actors and will particularly focus on engagement with women and youth in the context of their role not only in productivity but also in processing and marketing.', 'If adopted, new climate smart practices will result in increased farm level productivity of the main crops (maize, pearl millet, sorghum, groundnut, and cowpea) leading to increased food security, income, and revenues. With more productive farms, beneficiaries can increase their overall household income and achieve a higher standard of living. This in turn will give farmers the incentive to continue to pursue productivity enhancing technologies. \r\nResearch will also be conducted to ensure a pipeline of better performing technologies to be made available for the above process to continue. The research will address both breeding, complementary agronomic practices, safe and modern pest control measures, and natural resource management. This will be mainly applied and adaptive research to test existing technologies prior to dissemination. Research and sentinel surveillance will also be conducted on emerging issues so that new problems are tackled as they arise.\r\n', 'The proposed project is needed to increase farmersâ€™ uptake of existing innovations and increase the options from which farmers can choose. Adoption of improved technologies, coupled with youth and gender activities in the project, will not only increase productivity and incomes along value chains but also offer more opportunities to women and youth. Increase in economic opportunities for youth is especially expected to reduce their temptation to join crime related activities or dangerous migration attempts to urban cities.', 'No', '', 1, 1);

In the past 18 months the Sierra Leonean Leone has undergone a devaluation of 98% which has decreased the buying power of the currency during importation, thus increasing public and private sector expenditure in goods in relation to food security like processed rice which is known that Sierra Leone has spent $250 million on since 2021. Although the devaluation has a relatively negative impact on the current state of the spending of the nation it also creates an opportunity for competitive prices in the globalised market for increased export profits.\r\nSierra Leone is home to 5.5 million hectares of arable land which a mere 5% is being used for agricultural purposes. The data shows that there is significant demand to increase agricultural production in this sector of the economy. One of the major drawbacks as to the insufficient exporting activity is the lack of value addition to the raw products, in this case rice being the primary focus of this research project. \r\nThe â€œEnhancing Agro-Processing and Preservation Industriesâ€ project researches on strategies that will be implemented to form a foundational campaign to contribute to and impact the agricultural sector by identifying the nutritional contents of our home grown rice, creating capacity building exercises to educate stakeholders on the utilisation of preservation units and indigenous agro-processing technology to enhance the value of rice locally, sensitising the urban-rural population in different parts of Sierra Leone about the benefits of having proper quality rice produce and how it contributes to population and economic growth. \r\nWith these specifications in place the â€œEnhancing Agro-Processing and Preservation Industriesâ€ research project will aim to become a key component in the growth of the agricultural sector in Sierra Leone and the developments mentioned above being used to commence the commercial phase in the coming years to facilitate export opportunities.\r\nSierra Leone is endowed with abundant natural resources and fertile land, making agriculture a central pillar of its economy. However, despite its potential, the agricultural sector faces several challenges, including post-harvest losses, limited market access, and low-value addition.This project is essential for the following reasons:\r\n1. Economic Diversification:  Enhancing agro-processing diversifies the economy beyond traditional sectors, reducing dependency on raw commodities as the export source.\r\n2. Job Creation: The project will stimulate job creation in rural areas, particularly for women and youth, contributing to poverty reduction.\r\n3. Income Generation: Agro-processing adds value to raw agricultural products, increasing income for farmers and small-scale processors.\r\n4. Export Potential: By improving product quality and meeting international standards, Sierra Leone can tap into global markets, generating foreign exchange earnings.\r\n5. Food Security: Efficient agro-processing reduces post-harvest losses, ensuring a more stable food supply and improved food security.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the need for a project focused on improving Sierra Leone\'s agricultural sector is evident, aligning with his excellency Julius Maada Bioâ€™s â€œBIG FIVE GAME CHANGERSâ€ for the country\'s development goals:\r\n1. FEED SALONE. \r\n2. HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT FOR NURTURING SKILLS FOR 21ST-CENTURY INDUSTRY. \r\n3. YOUTH EMPLOYMENT SCHEME. \r\n4. REVAMPING THE PUBLIC SERVICE ARCHITECTURE THROUGH DELIVERY, EFFICIENCY AND PROFESSIONALISM.\r\n5. TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMMES TO SERVE AS PATHWAYS FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH. \r\n\r\nWith research results from 2022 showing  that 73% of the countryâ€™s population is food insecure and low rice crop yields occurring it is evident that a project of the agro processing and preservation type  will Shift Sierra Leone and its agricultural stakeholders into the mindset of food security and diversification.\r\nThe research project will also look to develop mechanised methods to processing high quality rice and with more grants & investments utilise the mechanised means to create an ecosystem to produce and process our own rice at a regional and international scale.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n1.Is there a competitive & comparative advantage in producing home grown rice as compared to imported rice?\r\n\r\n2.

Several survey to establish user preferences for a cooking stove would be caried out. This would be backed by an extensive market survey to understand the clean cooking technology market in Sierra Leone. ', 'Over 85% of Sub-Saharan Africans lack access to clean cooking technology. In Sierra Leone, a country with just 26% national electrification, residents depend chiefly on biomass for cooking. This does not only increase indoor air pollution but further facilitates deforestation and the destruction of critical biodiversity. In fact, indoor/household air pollution alone kills over 4.3 million people yearly. Cutting of trees for firewood and charcoal around the water catchment areas around the Freetown Peninsular Mountains has had adverse effect on the quantity of clean water available in the Guma Valley reservoir. This is reducing the Guma Valleyâ€™s capacity to meet the rising clean water access demand in Freetown. Cooking stoves are an essential part of households and play a significant role in meeting our daily cooking needs. There is a sense in which way we cook depicts the quality of life and our standard of living. While traditional stoves predominantly rely on fossil fuels such as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), there is a growing need for more sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives. One promising approach is to develop a hydrogen-oxygen (HHO) generator that can produce clean-burning fuel for cooking stoves. HHO generators utilize electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, which can then be used as a cooking fuel. Electrolysis of water for the production of hydrogen and oxygen is a very old technology dating back earlier than the 18th centuries. Electrolysis has of recent received growing research attention as the need to decarbonize the energy sector grows. Water electrolysis is currently being used in fuel cells for vehicles. However, there has been little or no attempt to utilize water electrolysis to address the lack of clean cooking technology in Africa. There are concerns about the energy efficiency, safety and cost consideration for the development and deployment/acceptance of water electrolysis for the purpose of clean cooking.

Assess the energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness:\r\nThe energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the HHO generator are the most crucial considerations of this research and a more paramount objective. The success of the design will be directly linked to low cost and high energy efficiency which will make the WATA-STOVE the best cooking option for all Sierra Leoneans and Africans. The following specific sub-objectives are therefore prioritized; \r\nâ€¢	Conduct a comparative analysis of the energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of HHO generation against traditional cooking fuels like LPG.\r\nâ€¢	Consider the lifecycle environmental impact of HHO generation and usage.\r\n3.	Investigate safety measures and regulatory considerations:\r\nHHO is highly flammable and oven risks explosion when subjected to critical pressure or when exposed to sparks/flame. The use of HHO for household cooking, therefore, poses a extra safety consideration. Therefore, the following sub-objectives need to be achieved for household use of HHO; \r\nâ€¢	Identify potential safety hazards associated with HHO generators and cooking with hydrogen-based fuels.\r\nâ€¢	Develop safety protocols and guidelines for the safe operation of HHO generators in households.\r\nâ€¢	Investigate and report on regulatory requirements and standards related to using HHO generators for cooking.\r\n4.	Evaluate user acceptance and adoption factors:\r\nThe assessment of the Sierra Leone clean cooking market is crucial for the success of the WATA-STOVE. There is need to understand the last-mile consumersâ€™ preferences for clean cooking solution. \r\nâ€¢	Conduct surveys and studies to assess user acceptance and perceptions of HHO generators for cooking.\r\nâ€¢	Identify potential barriers to adoption and propose strategies to overcome them.\r\nâ€¢	Explore the potential for incentives and policies to promote the adoption of HHO generators for cooking.\r\n5.	Explore scalability and integration with renewable energy sources:\r\nâ€¢	Investigate the potential for integrating HHO generators with renewable energy sources like solar.\r\nâ€¢	Evaluate the scalability of HHO technology for various cooking needs, from small households to commercial kitchens.\r\nThe research on HHO generators for cooking stoves holds the promise of providing a sustainable and clean energy solution for household cooking in Sierra Leone and Africa.

', 'The technology of HHO generation through electrolysis is an old 19th century invention which has gained more traction in the current day net zero carbon emission concerns. In fact, the green hydrogen technology in now deployed in power generation and a further deployment in hybrid electric vehicles has gone beyond the research and development phase. The world is gearing up for the commercialization of hydrogen vehicles which have more range than the conventional electric vehicles in addition to its carbon free fuel combustion. The WATA-STOVE design goes not seek to reinvent the wheel bot to rather scale down the fuel cell generator for the purpose of generating cooking gas that is free from carbon emission. ', 'The WATA-STOVE projectâ€™s success is highly hinged on the synergy in the technical cooperation of electrical and electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, chemists and environmental scientists. The need for expert analysis of the clean cooking market in Sierra Leone and the stakeholder analysis to establish evaluate the level of stake and interest of each stakeholder have significance in achieving the projectâ€™s objectives stated above. This multidiscipline nature of the project gives it the unique capacity put all skills and expertise at work produce the WATA-STOVE to provide a holistic local content solution to the lack of access to clean cooking technology in Sierra Leone. ', '1.	Facilitation of access to experts and skilled personnels \r\nThe existing collaborative approaches facilitates the involvement of experts into the project design and implementation. All parties and collaborators handle specific areas of the project which is in alignment with their specialization. This ensures efficiency and professionalism in delivering high quality design. \r\n2.	Collaborative approach leads to the provision of holistic solution \r\nThe collaborative effort among all parties involved in the project would ensure the WATA-STOVE design addresses the clean cooking technology access challenge that addresses the needs of the masses. Input and perspectives from all parties, including partners, collaborators and last-mile users of the WATA-STOVE would be essential in devising a solution that is widely acceptable. \r\n', 'The proposed environmental and socio-economic benefits of the WATA-STOVE are overwhelming. This innovation would lead to the development of the stove that uses water as fuel while utilizing solar energy to initiate the reaction that split the water (fuel) into the combustible HHO gas for cooking. The unique environmental impact is that the WATA-STOVE eliminates dependence on biomass for cooking thereby reducing deforestation. The WATA-STOVE also emits no carbon or pollutant gasses in the atmosphere thereby mitigating the yearly 4.3 million deaths owing to household air pollution. The economic impact of solar-powered WATA-STOVE - which uses water as fuel - is that the stove is cheap (costing almost nothing) to run and maintain. The life-cycle cost of the WATA-STOVE will be less than a tenth of the life-cycle cost of other cooking solutions including LPGs. The WATA-STOVE will deliver social justice in the access of clean cooking technology in the rural communities of Sierra Leone. This is because, water, which is the fuel needed to run the stove is available everywhere in rural Sierra Leone. The life-cycle cost of the WATA-STOVE does not depend on international supply chain of oil and gas, this makes the stove economically reliable.  ', 'No', '', 0, 4);

(11, 9, 43, 'UNICEF has been procuring almost 80% of the worldâ€™s RUTF. It has a similar nutrient composition to F-100 therapeutic milk, which is used to treat SAM in hospital settings. However, existing ready-to-use therapeutic (RUTFs) products are quite expensive and some countries are already producing affordable in-country RUTF.  This project aims at developing powdered and paste prototype RUTF products from locally-produced ingredients in Sierra Leone using modified or adaptable processing techniques. \r\nThe proposed project will be implemented in three phases over 21 months with activities ranging from product formulation and optimization to consumer studies and publishing our data. Product prototypes or composite mixes will be subjected to nutritional and physico-chemical analysis as well as to safety and storage stability analysis on all composite mix product prototypes. Products will further be subjected to sensory and consumer testing to select the best composite mix and determine acceptability. All data will be analyzed using uni-variate and multi-variate statistical analysis (SAS version 8.2 or higher) with a specific categorical model for Sensory and Consumer study.\r\nPartnerships will be established to holistically implement this project within the stipulated time frame. From designing the project to publishing its data, partnerships will be established to also ensure the aforementioned goal and objectives are achieved. The project will be governed and monitored by all implementing partners in their respective roles and in cross responsibilities. Anticipated outputs of such a project not only contributes to food security through increased crop production of key ingredients but also to reduction in economic cost of importing RUTFs whilst enhancing availability and accessibility at affordable cost that is anticipated in turn to contribute to the reduction of widespread malnutrition in Sierra Leone.\r\nKnowledge acquired from this project will be shared and disseminated via publication, conference meetings and with key stakeholders for expanded research including clinical trials and other end uses or application. Individual and organizational capacities are expected to be enhanced in terms of knowledge, skills and experience acquisition; in terms of resource strengthening is food processing and production and analytical capabilities. SciInnovtec Research and working partners are well positioned to undertake this type of project.', 'There is a longstanding recognition that under-nutrition is not only an individual problem but a national and global problem with strong ramifications for economic development in many low and middle income countries, and Sierra Leone is no exception. As the saying goes â€œyou are what you eatâ€. Sierra Leone has the fourth highest child under-five mortality rate in the world at 111 per 1,000 live births . Many children in the country die before reaching their 5th birthday and die simply from highly preventable and treatable causes such as malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea. Under-nutrition is the underlying cause in over one-third of under-five deaths and diseases, and nearly one-third (31 per cent) of children under-five suffer from stunting while five per cent are acutely malnourished (moderate and severe).  According to the causal framework of malnutrition, one of the immediate causes of malnutrition in Sierra Leone is poor dietary intake especially amongst nutritionally vulnerable groups such as mothers, infants and young children. Only 10% of children aged six to 23 months received the minimum acceptable diet, 43 per cent receive complementary foods the minimum number of times or more, and 24 per cent receive what is considered to be a diverse dietIbid-2. Amongst women aged 15 - 49 years, only 68 per cent receive what is considered a minimum diverse dietIbid-2. There has been a slight improvement in breastfeeding rates between 2010 and 2017 with strong advocacy for early initiation of breastfeeding that has increased from 45% to 55%, and exclusive breastfeeding rates rose from 32% to 52%Ibid-2 \r\n\r\nMicronutrient deficiencies are of crucial public health concern in Sierra Leone.  High prevalence of Anaemia is identified among women and children. Anaemia among women of reproductive age stands at 46.0 per cent, while Anaemia in pregnant women, and children under-5 stands at 70 per cent and 76.3 per cent respectively. In addition, 17.4 per cent of children 6 - 59 months are deficient in Vitamin A .  Over the past decades, various products and approaches for the prevention and treatment of childhood under-nutrition have been developed and tested5,6,7. Special nutritious foods have also been used to treat under-nutrition, and children with moderate acute to severe acute malnutrition (MAM & SAM) have over the last twenty (20) years used dried milk formula such as F75 and F1008, BP-5 or BP-100 that required in-hospital stay because the formula had to be made by qualified medical personnel due to the risk of using contaminated water and adequate dosage. The major RUTF on the market is the French brand â€˜Plumpy Nutâ€™ a peanut based product produced by Nuttiest. The company also produces various types of meals including emergency-based meals. The use of some of these energy-dense ready-to-use-therapeutic food (RUTF) has revolutionized the treatment of children with moderate and severe acute malnutrition with and without medical complications as it has made treatment possible and safer at the community level without the need for qualified medical personnel through the distribution of â€˜ready-to-useâ€™ food products that can be consumed without any preparation7,9. \r\n\r\nThe WHO/UNICEF have developed protocols for the composition of ready-to-use-therapeutic foods (RUTFâ€™s), and their use in the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) which has demonstrated their effectiveness10-14. However, no standardized approach exists for the formulation of ready-to-use therapeutic/supplementary foods (RUTF/RUSFâ€™s) or for approaches to prevention of undernutrition10,15. With high cost of importation, and for sustained supply of RUTFâ€™s, the WHO and various researchers have recommended the development of new therapeutic and supplementary foods that are more  affordable, acceptable, accessible, effective, and comparable with existing products in terms of their potential for preventing growth faltering and undernutrition7,10,12,15-20. In 2012, a linear programming tool was developed to help formulate locally sourced RUTFs that could meet international specifications21,22,23. Locally produced RUTFs were tested in Ethiopia, Ghana, Pakistan and India and gave overall good results in terms of acceptability (tested on severely malnourished children without clinical complication) and cost (40% cheaper than Plumpy-nut). Other countries including Cambodia, Uganda, Malawi etc., are now producing comparable local RUTF and RUSF that is contributing to treatment of moderate and severe acute malnutrition, and in turn to reduction in the overall malnutrition prevalence. Ghana recently introduced a local RUTF that is now successfully being commercialized by the private sector.\r\n\r\nA local formulation of food sprinkle containing peanut flour, palm oil, milk powder, sugar and vitamin mix was developed by the University of Parma in Italy for the treatment of moderately malnourished children in Sierra Leone24. The sprinkles were used in combination with commercial RUSF and showed slight improvement in treated children with this product. Currently there is an initiative called the Project Peanut Butter (PPB) in Sierra Leone that is funded by USAID that is producing RUTF using mostly imported ingredients and some local ones. One of PPBâ€™s product is a ready to use supplementary food (RUSF) for pregnant and malnourished women25. This group has also stalled in production due to not meeting UNICEF, WFP, WHO standards. Apart from PPB, no locally produced ready-to-use-therapeutic (RUTF) and ready-to-use-supplementary (RUSF) foods have been developed or reported for Sierra Leone. Hence, now more than ever, there is a need to develop in country local RUTF and RUSF to contribute to curbing malnutrition and preventing growth faltering amongst the 6-59 months old children in Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nProblem and Rational for RUTF Development and Nutritional Food Composition Profiling\r\n1.	Country status â€“ Despite some gains in made, Sierra Leone still has high prevalence of under-nutrition, as well as moderate and severe acute malnutrition amongst children under five years of age. \r\n2.	Donor cost - imported RUTFâ€™s are purchased and used in the treatment of Moderate and Severe Acute (MAM & SAM) malnourished children. UNICEF and other donors provide support to the Food and Nutrition Directorate (DFN) under the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and pays for majority of the imported RUTF products and in-patient treatment of SAM. The WFP spends thousands of dollars to procure RUTF from the United States each year and often the corrupt bureaucratic process involved at the customs office holds back aid supplies for lengthy periods causing food stuffs to perish in transit. Irish Aid, Helen Keller International etc., are strong nutrition donor organizations supporting the purchase of imported and the locally made Project Peanut Butter â€“ RUTF and complimentary supply from the Bennimix company in Sierra Leone. \r\n3.	Priority Level - To date there is no institution or research agency focused on conducting Food and Nutrition research to contribute to solutions in giving directions to solving the countries Food and Nutrition security problems. The Nutrition Directorate under the MoHS gets 90% of its support from donor agencies and limited support from the government. The Ministry of Agriculture does not prioritize Nutrition in their framework and critical information on food and nutrition is really just limited. There is no agency for regulation of food safety or food laws; no standard food testing laboratory which is critical to processing, analysis and quality assurance of developed products like a RUTF. From independence to date only few quantitative research work (less than 10%) has been done related to Food and Nutrition issues in Sierra Leone. Every other work and issues strongly focus on qualitative field research without reference to scientific quantitative research and solutions. \r\n\r\nAt present, every country is reeling back from the economic, financial, social, and health effects of Covid-19 that was globally and immeasurably felt around the world. Low to middle income and war-torn countries dependent on higher / upper income countries were affected and hit hard and across the socioeconomic strata from the vulnerable to upper income earners and businesses. Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates of under-nutrition in the world amongst its under-five population. Post Covid-19 impact and now the Russia â€“ Ukraine, and climate change effects are all exacerbating the situation and the high cost of imported RUTF and quality RUSFâ€™s does not meet the demand for therapeutic food supply. With an already struggling economy, decrease in importation of goods and restricted donor funding will see a re-surge in MAM and SAM in the country. \r\n\r\nIn view of the above, there is a strong need to develop these products using local indigenous crops/ingredients in Sierra Leone from economic, health and nutritional perspectives. The production of RUTF and RUSF by scientific standard with local ingredients common to the palate, will be more acceptable to mothers and children, less expensive for donors and government to purchase, and will be sustainably accessible, available and affordable in country. This approach of ONLY local ingredients has never been used or tested in Sierra Leone apart from mom and pop home-made mixes, donor imported products and one commercial complementary product (Bennimix) on the market in very limited quantities and does not meet UNICEF, WHO, and WFP standard composition (energy-nutrient density) for RUTF27.\r\n\r\nGoal: As stated above, the goal of this project is to research, develop/formulate RUTF product prototypes using 100% locally available ingredients that will make RUTF to be more available/accessible, affordable, and acceptable for the vulnerable group and most importantly in the treatment of MAM and SAM, and in the prevention of growth faltering in children in Sierra Leone.  \r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nTo develop ready-to-use therapeutic product prototypes, assess their nutritional, physic-chemical, sensory properties and consumer acceptability as well as clinically test the efficacy of formulated products. and analyse the cost of local production of the RUTF.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the project are: \r\n1.	Utilize modified process in a POWDER & PASTE product in the development of RUTF using 100% local ingredients/produce\r\n2.	To determine physicochemical properties, microbial safety, sensory, and preliminary safety of the prototypes\r\n3.	To determine the nutritional composition of products in meeting the energy density and daily nutrient intake for MAM, SAM and growth faltering children of 6 - 59months.\r\n4.	Determine safety, storage shelf life and stability of products under local conditions.\r\n5.	Perform cost analysis in comparison to current RUTFâ€™s on the market in Sierra Leone.\r\n6.	Perform mini consumer study on the prototypes with mothers\r\n7.	Develop strategic value and supply chain of raw ingredients to meet production demand.\r\n\r\nPartnerships will be established to holistically implement this project within the stipulated time frame. From designing the project to publishing its data, partnerships will be established to also ensure the aforementioned goal and objectives are achieved.\r\n', 'As iterated in the same question above project approach is product development using experimental (quantitative) approach to develop low cost, affordable and accessible nutrient dense Ready-To-Eat-Therapeutic Food for severe, moderate malnourished and growth faltering children. Key activities shall include;\r\nformulation of RUTF and process optimization with locally available ingredients, quality assessment and product analysis of RUTF prototypes, storage/shelf life and safety analysis,  selection of prototypes using sensory acceptance study with mothers (n-120), determine acceptability and purchase intent of consumers using a mini consumer study with 100 â€“ 120 mothers, assess cost analysis of RUTF prototypes in comparison to existing ones, develop crop value and supply chain of the crops utilized in the product prototype development with farmers, analyze all data and conclude with a project report write-up and submission, as well as manuscript preparation for publication.\r\n\r\nImmediate expected results of the project is a developed RUTF prototype, established value and supply chain for production, cost analysis for its production to determine affordability which are critical factors for the target population (mothers and children with severe to moderate malnutrition). Medium to long term benefits includes boost is agricultural production of the crops, health effect in correcting childrenâ€™s growth and health faltering effect that in turn reduces the prevalence of malnutrition across the country. This further contributes to the government of Sierra Leone meeting related MDG goals on mother and child nutrition and health. In addition, the development of such a product reduces the economic burden of importation of RUTF by donor partners like UNICEF, WFP, Irish Aid, WHO, that will leave resources to cater for other priorities.\r\n', 'Production of RUTFs is no longer a novelty in Africa or the world at large. However, just as in other countries that have produced theirs, what is unique in every country is the production of products with locally produced ingredients as opposed to imported ingredients or crops. In addition, the processing and production processes do take into consideration applicable traditional or local approaches that can be enhanced or more scientific approaches that can be modified to a sustainable system or approach. ', 'Home-made prototypes have been developed to first look at which bases are best suitable for local RUTF production in Sierra Leone. Product bases had included Rice, Cassava, Plantain, Sweet Potato and Yam. Cassava, plantains, Yam turned out to be more gummy in texture and bulkier hence, unsuitable for RUTF whereas Rice and sweet potatoes were less sticky and more powdery, thus suitable for this venture. Orange fleshed sweet potatoes is a better choice than white fleshed sweet potatoes. Plantain in small quantities enhances taste and flavour of products. Prior to this, the Lead / principal investigator as a food scientist and product developer has tested this concept years ago with cassava and plantain bases for her masterâ€™s studies in food science and was proven to be excellent working prototypes if processed with 100% local ingredients and analysed for meeting the standard nutrient-energy density requirements for malnourished children. The recent World Bank sponsored preliminary study for RUTF production in Sierra Leone by the University of Greenwich, UK and the Department of Food & Nutrition of Ministry of Health and Sanitation of the Government of Sierra Leone which I was part of that study indicated the dire need to produce local RUTF in Sierra Leone. ', 'Our RUTF project is an interdisciplinary project that draws on knowledge, skills and experience in Nutrition, Agriculture, Food Science, Analytical Chemistry, Project Management, Statistics and administration to achieve the project objectives. The added value of the interdisciplinary nature of the project is being well exploited and suited in the respective roles and responsibilities of specific activities in the project. The transdisciplinary character of the project further falls under two inter-related areas in the calls for proposal â€“ 1) Food Security and Agriculture that seeks to promote the development of agro processing and preservation while enhance value addition for the local market and exports; 2)Health/Good Health & well-being that seeks to develop innovative products leading to reduction in infant mortality.', 'The added value as stated above ensures that specific expertise in the identified activity works in collaboration with others to perform their tasks in achieving a related objective.    ', 'The relevance of the proposed project cannot be overemphasized in terms of use because there is a strong need to develop these products using local indigenous crops/ingredients in Sierra Leone from an economic, social, health and nutritional perspective.

From a societal impact, its relevance is embedded in the possible reduction in the incidence and prevalence of malnutrition that marks up meeting part of our Health and Nutrition sustainable development (SDG) goals.', 'No', '', 1, 1),
(12, 21, 56, 'Agriculture has a crucial role to play in improving nutrition. The persistence of malnutrition as global public health concern makes clear that alleviating malnutrition cannot be solved merely by health/nutrition alone but requires better linkage between nutrition and agriculture. The development challenge is increasing rate of rural household malnutrition due to continuous lack of vegetables in diets, usually affecting the health of the rural population causing illnesses and reduction in productivity in Sierra Leone. Hence, there is an urgent need to investigate the potential of indigenous vegetables in tackling malnutrition at house hold level. The purpose of this proposal will be to evaluate the potential of indigenous vegetables as an economic and sustainable way of reducing malnutrition and food insecurity at house hold level. In Sierra Leone where the diets are mostly dominated with carbohydrate foodstuff, indigenous vegetables will constitute a good, cheap and most available source of vitamins and minerals to tackle malnutrition. It is anticipated that this aim will be achieved through the following specific objectives: \r\nTo conduct household survey to obtain baselines information on the utilization of indigenous vegetable species in Sierra Leone; To collect, classify to lowest taxonomic level and determine the nutritive properties for each vegetable species collected; To evaluate and characterize the morphological features, yield potential and market values of such traditional vegetable species under field domestication; To develop production manual for sustainable production of traditional vegetable species in Sierra Leone. The proposed research will be implemented in three phases beginning with surveying and collection of indigenous vegetable germplasm followed by research trial and management and then the development of manual for indigenous vegetable production and management. It is expected that the research will identify indigenous vegetable species with nutritive value and integrate them in the market supply system as a pathway to crop diversification to tackle rural household malnutrition and food insecurity situations. It will also serve as database for linkage between agriculture and nutrition at national level to inform evidence-based decisions for farmers, extension agents, and policymakers. The proposed research will last for two years for an estimated budget of USD 45,000.\r\n', 'Agriculture has a crucial role to play in improving nutrition. It is the primary source of food and essential nutrients and an important livelihood source for many rural households. Despite its potential to alleviate malnutrition, most malnourished are in effect rural people who are trapped in a situation of low-productive agriculture, poor health and poverty. Malnutrition at household level has become a confronted issue in the health and nutritional sectors in Sierra Leone. This is because food, often regarded as one of the basic needs of mankind seems to be a scarce commodity in many households in Sierra Leone and agriculture has not adequately considered as a vehicle to improve nutrition. As such, Sierra Leone is ranked as the third hungriest countries in the world (Global Hunger index, 2017) and is presently confronted with a growing nutritional related disease outbreak. The recent COVID-19 and previously Ebola epidemic, hit hardest both at rural and urban communities of Sierra Leone could further aggravate the situation. It devastating consequences will affect the health and livelihoods of Sierra Leoneans, especially the rural communities for a considerable period of time. Vegetables, grown by almost every farming family in Sierra Leone with dominant female participation, play a significant role in providing quality food and nutritional security as well as poverty alleviation. But currently, growers do not seem to invest in production but look for ways of coping with lesser inputs. This attitude degrades them to a stage of where coping becomes unprofitable and malnutrition, a recipe for disease situations at house hold level, high risk exposure to zoonotic diseases and decreased house-hold food security in Sierra Leone. \r\n\r\nThe development challenge is malnutrition at rural household due to lack of vegetables in the diets of rural household, usually affecting the health of the rural population causing illnesses and reduction in productivity. Vegetables are considered as major sources of nutrients that are required for the building of a healthy nation. Their deficiencies in the basic diets have been observed to be highly implicated in the infection of some deleterious diseases that seriously undermine the health of a nation, particularly in pregnant women and children that seem to be more sensitive and vulnerable to malnutrition. Nutrition has always had a more health focus and has not adequately considered agriculture as a key vehicle to improve nutrition. The persistence of malnutrition as a global public health concern makes clear that alleviating poor nutrition cannot be solved merely from health/nutrition alone but requires better linkage of the two sectors (health/nutrition and agriculture sectors). \r\nThe cultivation of and sale of vegetables in communities of Sierra Leone provide a major income for vegetable growers, and more interestingly, majority of vegetable growers are women, thus emphasizing on their participation in agriculture. This overtly indicates a response to the growing demands of gender equity and participation in development programs which invariably should be exploited to address the issues of poverty alleviation and food security. Sierra Leone being a tropical country has a huge potential of natural resources with plant biodiversity constituting a significant portion. However, it is interesting to note that, despite the richness and diversity of plant, only 10% is domesticated, the remaining 90% is yet to be exploited to enhance food security. Though few indigenous vegetables have been identified as edible with high potential of nutritive values, they are in most cases completely neglected and underutilized putting them under the category of crops called Neglected and underutilized species. This category of crop species possess huge potential in remedying food security situation particularly in Sierra Leone where these crops are lying wasted and crop diversification is scarcely utilized in the crop production system. In addition to their nutritive value potential, indigenous vegetable crops are rich in medicinal values which can be exploited to cure certain ailments such as obesity and diabetes. Despite the above stated, there is little or no research on the potential of traditional vegetables.as cheap alternative nutritional supplements for poor households in Sierra Leone, hence, people are unaware of the nutritional composition, quantity and value of these crops in preventing malnutrition. \r\nIn order to promote food nutrition and security agenda, focus has to be made towards alternative vegetable production as rice and cassava production alone cannot do much in achieving food based nutrition and food security in Sierra Leone. It is in this concept the Department of Horticulture, Njala University has initiated the idea to direct a research focus on indigenous vegetables to identify species that could serve as substitutes to exotic types and be incorporated in to human nutrition for food based nutrition and food security in Sierra Leone. \r\nResearch goal: The main purpose of this project proposal will be to evaluate the potential of traditional vegetables for species identification with high nutritive valve to serve as economic and sustainable way of reducing malnutrition, poverty and food insecurity at house hold level in Sierra Leone.\r\nSpecific Objectives: To conduct a household survey on  traditional vegetable species with potential to reduce malnutrition and improve human health at house hold level for incorporation in to growersâ€™ cultivation practices;  To determine the nutritive properties of the collected traditional vegetable species through laboratory analysis;  To evaluate and characterize the morphological features, yield potential and market values of such traditional vegetable species under field domestication (ex-situ conservation);  To develop management guidelines and manual for sustainable production of traditional vegetable species in Sierra Leone.\r\n', 'Agriculture has a crucial role to play in improving nutrition.

This will enhance scientific knowledge on the potential of under-utilized indigenous vegetable species in tackling malnutrition and integrate it in the feeding habit of rural households as a pathway of food diversification in Sierra Leone. The Ebola epidemics and COVID-19 pandemic have further exposed the weaknesses of the countryâ€™s public healthcare system in tackling nutritional related disease outbreak, indicating that over dependence on this institution for human health care could be catastrophic. Identifying traditional vegetables, produced with less resource input investment with similar nutritive values could reduce the over-dependence on public health and exotic vegetable species in tackling malnutrition particularly among rural households in Sierra Leone. Studies have shown that traditional vegetables contain higher nutritional values than the exotic species. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative nutritional supplements through research that offers the poor and food insecure households with cheap and most available source of essential micro-nutrients for diseases prevention. In spite of their nutritive and medicinal values, only 10% is domesticated, the remaining 90% is yet to be exploited to enhance food security. Even though such crops have been identified as edible, yet they are in most cases completely neglected and underutilized. Identification and utilization of such category of crop species could be a novelty to serve as potential remedy for malnutrition and food security situation particularly in Sierra Leone where these crops are lying wasted and crop diversification is scarcely utilized in the crop production system. Moreover, indigenous vegetables can serve as major sources of robust agronomic traits offering invaluable opportunities in breeding, ', 'Vegetables are vital for human health not only in combating malnutrition but also in reducing deaths from related diseases. In Sierra Leone where the diet is dominated by starchy foodstuff, vegetable will constitute a good, cheap and most available source of vitamins and minerals. According to WHO, malnutrition is directly or indirectly responsible for about 3.5 million child deaths every year in Africa, a situation partly attributed to low vegetable intake (Ëƒ400g/day). Sadly enough, global measures to reduce this menace in the country appear to be towards the introduction of food supplements and utilization of exotic vegetable species which are usually expensive and inaccessible by many rural households. Therefore, research focus towards the identification, production and utilization of underutilized vegetables is needed in order to achieve food based nutrition and reduces malnutrition and food insecurity. Whilst tradition vegetables utilization is low in Sierra Leone, their identification and promotion of utilization can increase yield, balanced year round nutrition, provide new market opportunities and enhance farm income, thus improving livelihoods and food security at rural households. Furthermore, the identification and utilization of indigenous vegetables will enhance balanced nutrition and prevent degenerative diseases at rural households, who are suffering micronutrient malnutrition. Otherwise, hunger, poverty, malnutrition and disease situations will be aggravated. Besides, findings from this research will increase the knowledge base of researchers and extension agents on the role of indigenous vegetables in alleviating malnutrition and food insecurity. This project will also benefit the private sectors, who are engaged in vegetable seed, food processing and health food industries. They will be better positioned to capitalize indigenous vegetables for the development of small and medium enterprises in the country. Finally, since vegetable growing in multiple cropping systems requires high labor inputs, the project will benefit rural women and youths by creating employment opportunities.', 'The successful implementation this proposed research will require the combination of multiple academic disciplines. Knowledge and expertise will be drawn from several fields like horticulture, nutrition and dietetics, crop science, crop protection, biostatistician, finance unitetc. in order to achieve the intended research outcomes. Inter-and Trans- disciplinary approach will be exploited by forming strong collaboration around the research by appropriate expertise. Expertise in horticulture, crop science and crop protection will be needed to identify indigenous vegetable species in the wild and determine best production and management practices in the field trial. That of the nutritionist will be required to identify the type and quantity of nutritive properties in indigenous vegetables required to control or prevent malnutrition. The biostatistician will be needed for setting up the experimental design and the finance personnel to help in managing donor funds. ', 'Collaboration-based approaches will be adopted to cooperate around a main objective of this research to add credibility and quality to the research outcome and offer guidance on the key challenges. Potential areas of collaboration this research will seek include: capacity building activities, efficiency of the food supply chain, social safety nets and health care in the rural areas, agriculture-related small and medium enterprises in the rural areas, and public-private partnership in vegetable seed industry and agricultural biotechnology. Thus possible linkages with the following working groups on specific areas of complementary efforts include:\r\nâ€¢	Human Resources Development Working Group: to design appropriate methods to share knowledge, experience, and skills in strengthening R&D capacity on indigenous vegetables (IVs).  \r\nâ€¢	Telecommunications and Information Working Group: to improve information infrastructure for sharing knowledge and information on IVs, and to build the database on IVs. \r\nâ€¢	Research and Technology Working Group: to strengthen research and development management capacity on IVs.  \r\nâ€¢	Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Working Group: to capitalize and transform the potential of health-promoting values of IVs into SME in the country.\r\nâ€¢	Gender Focal Point Network: to integrate gender considerations into the follow-up, collaborative activities on indigenous vegetable research and development focusing on improving womenâ€™s income generation and nutrition. \r\n', 'In Sierra Leone where the diet is dominated by starchy foodstuff, indigenous vegetable will constitute a good, cheap and most available source of proteins, vitamins and minerals. Certainly, the identification and promotion of indigenous vegetable production and utilization will be of both economic and societal relevance.

(15, 25, 75, 'Abstract \r\nBackground: The main goal of this project is to strengthen intersectoral collaboration in the prevention of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using a one health approach. The project will create a platform to understand gender intersection with other demographic dimensions and socio-economic perspective at a human, animal and environmental sector interface in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone. The project\'s overall outcome is establishing a coordinated AMR prevention framework that defines gender intersection with other demographics, social and economic dimensions in Sierra Leone. \r\nMethods: We will achieve this goal by conducting desk review to inform a qualitative study on gender intersectionality in AMR prevention using an impact pathway logic model as an analytical framework (Anderson et al., 2011). We will find out what works (outcomes and impacts of AMR interventions on gender intersectionality)? How (strategies and outputs, type of governance approach and specificity of interventions on AMR prevention)? Whom (actors, organizations, type of activities)? And why (barriers/failures, opportunities/key success factors on AMR prevention)? The findings from the qualitative study will be used to train stakeholders and develop a road map on gender intersection with other demographic and socio-economic dimensions in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone. \r\nLocation: Western Area of Sierra Leone\r\nTimeline: January 2024 and February 2025\r\n', 'AMR is a growing public health problem. In a recent global estimate, AMR is responsible for 4.9 million deaths worldwide, with the highest death rates in West Africa (Murray et al., 2022). Many low-income countries, such as Sierra Leone, do not have sufficient resources to undertake interventions to prevent AMR ((Cox et al., 2017).  These gaps may have contributed to the deep-rooted challenges in this field, including inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans (Lakoh et al. 2022; Lakoh et al. 2023), and high prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens in humans and animals of Sierra Leone (Lakoh et al., 2020; Mansaray et al., 2022).\r\nSierra Leone, a low-income country in West Africa, has been affected by major public health emergencies, including the largest Ebola outbreak [GoSL, 2015]. Before the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, the country had no multisectoral response system to prevent AMR. Consequently, the government established a One Health coordinating system to guide multi-sectoral response to emerging global health threats such as AMR in 2020. However, this development has not changed the country\'s multisectoral approach to AMR prevention. There is little information on the AMR prevention landscape in the country. A recent way to understand complex health issues such as the threat posed by AMR is to apply the concept of intersectionality. The concept of intersectionality describes the ways in which systems of inequality based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, class and other forms of discrimination â€œintersectâ€ to create unique dynamics and effects, particularly on health. Gender inequalities in health has been recognized as critical in addressing complex challenges in health (Annandale et., al 2020, Heise et. al 2019, Campos-Serna et al. 2013), including addressing the threats posed by AMR.  The interaction of human biology and socio-cultural norms and beliefs make women more susceptible to AMR. Women\'s exposure to AMR and antimicrobial use (AMU) is higher during pregnancy, menstruation, childbirth and abortion. In addition, young women face higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other diseases (Batheja et., al, 2022, Jones et al. 2022).\r\nAll forms of inequality are mutually reinforcing and must therefore be analysed and addressed simultaneously to prevent one form of inequality from reinforcing another. For example, tackling the gender pay gap alone â€“ without including other dimensions such as socio-economic status â€“ will likely reinforce inequalities among women. Thus, the relevance of this project. \r\nResearch objectives and specific aims \r\nThe main goal of this project is to strengthen intersectoral collaboration on the prevention of AMR at a human-animal-environment interface using a one health approach. The project will create a platform to understand gender intersection with other demographic dimensions and social and economic diversity in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone in line with the objectives of the National Science, Technology and Innovation Council (NSTI) of Sierra Leone. The overall outcome of the project is a coordinated AMR prevention framework that defines gender intersection with other demographics, social and economic dimensions in Sierra Leone. Our specific aims are: \r\nâ€¢	Objective 1: To understand gender intersectionality in the AMR prevention landscape by mapping existing structures and capacity for AMR prevention through desk reviews, key informant interviews, and stakeholder engagement. We hypothesize that there are various stakeholders with a different social, demographic and economic background in the field of AMR in Sierra Leone but these are not currently known. These stakeholders will be known with our intervention.  The proposed output for this phase is a defined gender intersectionality framework in the AMR prevention landscape in Sierra Leone.  The outcomes of this objective are 1) a defined gender intersectionality framework in the AMR prevention landscape in the Western Area of Sierra Leone and 2) Manuscript with a proposed title â€˜Gender intersectionality with other dimensions in AMR prevention landscape in Sierra Leone: a qualitative studyâ€™\r\nâ€¢	Objective 2: To build the capacity of stakeholders working on the AMR space in the Western Area of Sierra Leone. We will use the information generated from the landscape analysis to build the capacity of AMR stakeholders through training.  Our proposed output for aim 2 is an informed AMR prevention stakeholders in Sierra Leone. \r\nâ€¢	Objective 3: To develop a road map for gender intersectionality in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone. We will build a consensus and define a road map on AMR that takes into consideration the intersection of gender and other demographic dimensions with social and economic diversity of AMR prevention in Sierra Leone.  Our proposed output is a road map for gender intersectionality in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone. \r\nDescription of the project \r\n1.	Project design and study duration\r\nThe project will use a longitudinal approach with a timeline spanning 14 months (January 2024 to February 2025), focused on understanding and improving the AMR prevention landscape in the Western Area of Sierra Leone. We will build upon the groundwork laid by our existing initiatives such as the Western Area Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (Lakoh et al. 2023). We will employ an impact pathway logic model as an analytical framework, derived from Anderson et al. (2011), to dissect the factors that contribute to gender intersectionality AMR prevention. This model will guide us in answering research questions such as:\r\nâ€¢	What works in AMR prevention (e.g., Successful interventions for treating STIs and thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic use)?\r\nâ€¢	How are these interventions executed (e.g., Training of healthcare professionals)?\r\nâ€¢	By whom are they implemented (e.g., Government ministries, department and agencies, NGOs)?\r\nâ€¢	Why do they work or not work (e.g., Community engagement, funding)?\r\n2.	Study settings\r\nSierra Leone has an estimated 8 million people, 42% of whom are under 15 and over 50% are women (SSL 2015). It is a poor country with an income per capita of $410 in 2022 [IMF 2023]. The country has five geographic regions, including the Western Area (urban and rural), which is the most densely populated region with about 1.5 million people and includes the capital, Freetown (SSL 2015). \r\nThe country established a national AMR program and one health coordinating platform in 2018 and 2020, respectively. After consultation with several stakeholders in Sierra Leone, the Western Area of Sierra Leone was selected for the implementation of the project in the midst of little resources as it provides a central role in the implementation of health activities in the country. \r\n3.	Sample size\r\nWe will use a heterogeneous, horizontal sampling approach using maximum sampling variance and an actor network theory. This means that we will â€˜followâ€™ each AMR prevention intervention to identify those who created, implemented and were impacted by it (Oâ€™Neill et al. 2014). We will interview â‰¥10 AMR prevention stakeholders for each case using the impact pathway logic model (Anderson et al. 2014). We will query whether and how gender intersection considerations were embedded in policy development, implementation or evaluation. We will continue sampling until the case has been fully described and no new relevant actors are identified.\r\n4.	Study population\r\nThe project will evaluate individuals, institutions or organizations and youth groups working in the field of AMR prevention to understand gender intersectionality in Sierra Leone. \r\n5.	Sampling method\r\nThe project will be implemented in three phases as shown the framework in Appendix 1.\r\nâ€¢	Phase I: Analysis of the AMR prevention landscape \r\nIn phase I, we will use the impact pathway logic model to determine gender intersectionality in the AMR\r\nprevention landscape through desk reviews, stakeholder meetings and key informant interviews. We plan to map stakeholders under the human, animal and environmental domains in the public and private, including healthcare workers, livestock and wild life farmers, engineers, environmentalists, civil society groups, youth-led organizations, non-governmental and community-based organizations, government ministries, departments and agencies and other policy makers and implementers that are critical in AMR prevention. \r\nWe will review the existing literature to examine the AMR policy and implementation environment using a gender perspective. The information generated will be disaggregated by age, sex and other demographic and social variables and coded to inform the key informant interviews and further mapping of the stakeholders.  Thereafter, we will develop a protocol using purposeful and snowball sampling techniques to identify stakeholders and conduct in-depth interviews to understand the scope of gender considerations in AMR activities in Sierra Leone. Through their experience narratives, we will explore themes such as gender disparity in AMR prevention. We will analyze and hold stakeholder meetings to validate the findings and identify gaps in gender intersectionality in AMR prevention. The proposed output for this phase is a defined gender intersectionality framework in the AMR prevention landscape in the Western Area of Sierra Leone.   \r\nâ€¢	Phase II: Meeting to train stakeholders in the field of AMR and disseminate the findings\r\nDuring this phase, we will use the findings from the landscape analysis to train and create awareness about AMR prevention among stakeholders. We will also use this meeting to disseminate the findings from this study. Our proposed output for aim 2 is an informed AMR prevention stakeholder in Sierra Leone. \r\nâ€¢	Phase III: Build a consensus and establish a road map on AMR prevention in Sierra Leone \r\nIn the last phase, we will engage stakeholders to build a consensus and map actionable strategies that address gender intersectionality and other gaps in AMR prevention. We will map strategies under gender mainstreaming in AMR, impact of climate change on AMR, advocacy, community engagement, governance and leadership, and research, development and innovation.  Our proposed output is a road map for gender intersectionality in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone, including mainstreaming performance measures into one health to track sustainability.\r\n6.	Data collection\r\nTo facilitate our key informant interviews, we will conduct a desk review of grey and peer reviewed literature to identify similar studies querying gender intersectionality in AMR prevention. We will use these studies to inform the development of an interview guide. We will also use the intersectionality-based policy analysis framework to inform questions on how gender intersectionality in AMR prevention was prioritized, decided, implemented and evaluated. We will collect participant demographic information (occupation, years in practice, role in AMR decision making, organization, age, gender, social and economic status). \r\nConsenting individuals will participate in a single, semi-structured 60â€“90-minute key informant interviews by experienced qualitative researchers. Interviews will be offered in local languages, and data will be translated to English prior to analysis and transcribed verbatim. Interviewers will take detailed field notes during interviews. \r\n7.	Data management and analysis\r\nWe will assign a unique ID to all participants. Participants names will not be included in the transcripts. Audio files of the key informant interviews will be stored on a secured computer before transcription. Transcriptions and audio files will only be accessible to the study team. Any paper copies will be stored in a locked filing cabinet.  Audio files will be permanently deleted after transcriptions are complete. The anonymized written transcripts will be stored for a minimum of 10 years. \r\nSummary statistics of the findings of the key informant interviews will be generated for demographic variables to gain insights into the diversity of the study groups. Interview data will be coded using open and axial coding to generate themes. Two experienced researchers will independently read three transcripts from each unit of analysis to gain familiarity with the content and conduct open coding to develop a codebook. Each research duo will double-code 20% of randomly selected transcripts. Coding discrepancies between -1 and 0.7 will be discussed and resolved by coders; a third reviewer will resolve disagreements. We will continue double coding sets of n=3 interview transcripts until interrater reliability is â‰¥0.70. The remaining transcripts will be singled coded using thematic analysis. We will report our findings using a gender intersectionality lens, which is relatively nascent in qualitative methods but aligns well with our study methods. \r\n\r\n8.	Quality assurance\r\nInvolvement of various country experts on AMR in developing this proposal is the initial measure to improve the quality of the proposed research work. All the collaborators rigorously scrutinized the developed proposal. \r\nDespite this initial mapping of stakeholders, further mapping will be carried out prior to the commencement of the research work. Following mapping, all the stakeholders will be engaged to review, standardize and validate the study protocol and tools. \r\nThe study guide for the key informant interviews will be pretested and corrections will be made for minor errors. Training will be provided to the research team, and effective supportive supervision will be carried out at all stages of the research work.\r\nThe study team will adhere to all ethical protocols and follow standards and norms at every research stage. Data generated from this study are going to be appropriately managed. The authors will make appropriate declarations where they are needed prior to dissemination of findings. \r\nSustainable Health System (SHS) will appropriately manage the allocated financial resources for the research work. The internal audit of SHS will periodically review the management of the financial resources of the research project. Where an inevitable risk is anticipated, the research team will communicate this to NSTIC, clearly stating the possible mitigation strategies.\r\nAt the end of the project, financial as well technical reports will be prepared and submitted to NSTIC. SHS and the research team welcome any request from NSTIC to carry out an external audit evaluation of the project implementation during and after its expiration. \r\n9.	Disseminated results and publication \r\nWe will publish our findings in Open Access peer-reviewed journals and present them at national and international conferences where relevant. We will also summarize the findings and report them to the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee and the Scientific Committee of Sustainable Health Systems (SHS).\r\nWe will publish our findings in open-access peer-reviewed journals according to the Equator network guidelines (e.g., STROBE). Internationally, we will engage with NSTIC to identify suitable forums for dissemination. We aim to produce multiple modes of information dissemination and methods to ensure relevant ministries, departments and agencies, other partners in the one health platform, participants and communities can access the study findings, including information leaflets, social media and policy briefs.\r\nFinally, we have proposed a training and dissemination meeting during the project implementation to make stakeholders well-informed about the findings and AMR in general. \r\n', 'Project design and study duration\r\nThe project will use a longitudinal approach with a timeline spanning 14 months (January 2024 to February 2025), focused on understanding and improving the AMR prevention landscape in the Western Area of Sierra Leone.

A PubMed search in October 10, 2023 using the term â€˜gender intersectionality in antimicrobial resistanceâ€™ revealed only two articles and none reported information on gender intersectionality in the context of one health (Wemrell et al. 2022; Gautron et al. 2023). We have proposed an innovate project that will leverage the one health platform to understand and build gender intersectional landscapes and address inequalities and disparities in AMR prevention in Sierra Leone. Our proposal development engaged female and male collaborators in the one health framework, demonstrating the ability of women to take leadership roles in AMR prevention in a low-income country. A private-public sector interface will be created through the one health platform. \r\nOur project is creative in that innovative approaches such as the use of technology to aid appropriate antimicrobial use and online mentorship services will be the bedrock of the AMR prevention landscape analysis. Another uniqueness of this project is the local ownership of a landscape analysis in AMR prevention in a low-income country like Sierra Leone.  \r\n', 'In anecdotal discussions with Sierra Leoneans in the field of AMR, they hypothesize that the activities of AMR prevention among different stakeholders are sub-optimal because many do not have sufficient capacity to implement AMR prevention activities. Evidence from a scoping review has shown that one health approaches enhance strategies to prevent global health threats such as AMR (Robbiati et al., 2023). Furthermore, the intersection of gender and other demographic dimensions with social and economic dimensions in AMR prevention on AMR in Sierra Leone are unclear. Therefore, it is important to understand and build the AMR prevention landscape. Knowing more about the AMR prevention landscape has important public health implications for addressing disparities, including intersectional gaps between gender and other dimensions and climate change. \r\nThe planned step-by-step approach to understanding and framing the gender intersectional landscape in the Western Area will provide innovative learning tools for national AMR landscape analysis in Sierra Leone and other low-income countries.

(16, 8, 5, 'Agricultural production is constrained by many variables, prominent among which is biotic pressure of insect pests which is observed to significantly undermine productivity of crops, with a dire consequences of achieving food security. The management of insect pests has been dominated by the use of chemical pesticides, though it is observed of having immediate effects of reducing the pest population below the economic injury level, however, their usage is associated with myriad of problems: environmental degradation, pest resurgence, secondary pest outbreak , development of resistant genes in insects as well as health hazards caused to farmers. These challenges have dictated a paradigm shift to seek viable options that harmonize the management of pests with the environment in which much attention has been attracted to the use of natural enemies technically referred to as biological control. Fortunately, natural enemies are in close association with pests in inflicting mortality on the pest population under natural conditions . This association provides unique opportunity for the exploitation and utilization natural enemies for sustainable pest management option. This project aimed at developing a biological control program constituting an established research unit for the utilization of biological control agents with a focus on predators, parasitoids and entomo-pathogens against insect pests. This ambition will be achieved through a survey of agro-ecologies to identify, quantify key agricultural pests and associated natural enemies, study their biology, underscoring the functional and numerical response of natural enemies as attributes of ideal bio-control agents. Biological studies of the key pests and associated natural enemies will be investigated in the laboratory, and subsequently evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. This project will further delve on the exploitation of virulent fungi species for their utilization as bio-pesticides for the management of insect pests. The fungal strains will be isolated through tissue culture techniques, the active ingredients will be extracted and characterized for virulence features and then exploited for development of bio-pesticides. It is expected that the establishment of  biological control facility will promote environmentally  sustainable management of insect pests to boost crop productivity and  strengthening food security in Sierra Leone.   ', '      Agricultural is considered as the main backbone of the economy in Sierra Leone with an engagement of almost 53% of the population in the cultivation of a wide range of crops including but not limited to cash crops, cereals, tubers, fruits and vegetables crops either directly for   household consumption or  in some instances marketing the products  to generate income.  Cash crops like coffee, cocoa, oil palm, cashew being economic crops are mostly grown for export to generate foreign income. The female folks constitute a significant proportion of farming community in Sierra Leone particular in vegetable farming where activities are gender friendly \r\n     Yield gap analysis of agricultural crops has significantly underscored insect pests as major constraint to production of agricultural crops at both vegetative and reproduction stages of plant. Damage can vary from light infestation where there is reduction in crop yield to severe infestation leading to total collapse of entire fields. Notably, insect infestations are aggravated when insect pests are observed to serve as vectors to some deleterious viral, bacteria and fungi diseases that remain residual on crops and in the environment. Chemical pesticides are habitually used to manage insect pests both in field and in storage. Despite their potency to drastically reduce pest population below the economic injury levels, their use is however associated with myriad of environmental, social and health implications. These challenges include but not limited to environmental degradation and pollution, killing of non-target organisms including natural enemies and pollinators, pest resurgence, secondary pest outbreak, development of resistant genes in the target insects, health hazards to the users among others. \r\nThese highlighted challenges are quite obvious dictate a paradigm shift to the use of natural enemies technically referred to as biological control as a viable option which is environmentally friendly and sustainable. Fortunately the paradigm shift is quite feasible as the natural environment is endowed with natural enemies defined as predators, parasitoids and entomo-pathgens are in close association with insect pests thriving under the same environmental conditions that are observed to inflict mortality on the insects under natural conditions. This endowment provides unique opportunity for their exploitation from their natural settings for subsequent domestication, mass rearing and release into agro-ecosystems.  Unequivocally, this management strategy of agricultural pests is an illustrious innovation as a viable pest management option which can be sustained at all time without hindrance to its sustainability and environmental integrity. \r\n Though biological control is not new globally, there is however no national recognized biological control facility in Sierra Leone that focuses on the utilization of natural enemies namely predators, parasitoids, entomo-pathogens as natural  substitutes to synthetic pesticides on commercial basis.  The general goal of this project is therefore to establish a biological control facility with an enhanced scientific calibre for commercial utilization of predators, parasitoids and myco-insecticides for management of wide range of agricultural insect pests. It is expected that the establishment of this facility will create a platform for sustainable management of agricultural pests to boost production of agricultural crops.  Equally importantly, this facility will serve as centre of excellence for capacity building and research on and pest management efforts attracting both private and public sectors for collaboration with a pillar of commercialization\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSpecific objectives are indicated below : \r\n1  To identify and quantify the key pest  and common natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, entomo-pathogenic fungi) and ecological distribution . \r\n     This objective will critically look into the ecological distributions of the key pests and natural enemies (predators, parasitoids and entomo-fungi) in five agro-ecological settings underscoring their co-existence under natural conditions. The collected pests and  the natural enemies will be classified to taxonomic order and family respectively. The tempo-spatial   distribution and pattern and abundance of the pests in association with the natural enemies will constitute part of this objective.    \r\n  2.  To determine the biological attributes (development and reproduction) and population dynamics of key pests and natural enemies. \r\n   Biological characterization exercise will critically look into the population dynamics and life table parameters of selected key pests, predators and parasitoids under simulated laboratory conditions. Characterization of the predators and parasitoids will significantly contribute to information leading to the efficacy of the biological attributes of natural enemies as ideal candidates for biological control. The functional and numerical responses which are biological features depicting the efficacy of natural enemies will be evaluated against the target pests. The selected predators and parasitoids will be evaluated under greenhouse conditions depicting semi-field conditions where climatic or natural conditions are partially manipulated. Field trials will be conducted on farmers plots and experimental plots under natural settings. Environmental cues such as temperature and humidity that are most likely trigger pest seasonal outbreaks and distribution pattern will be simulated in the laboratory for investigation and the manner of dormancy during off-season periods will be investigated for 4 main key pests. \r\n\r\nObjective 3   To identify virulent fungi isolates/strains for the development of myco-insecticides as  organic pesticides for the management of agricultural pests \r\nThis is the preliminary stage of developing organic pesticide sector. The agro-ecologies will be scouted to identify fungal infected cadavers. The fungal spores  will be isolated from host sources and then characterized for virulence against selected target pests by determining the toxicity parameters like Lethal Time (LT50) and Lethal Concentration (LC50) These parameters depict  the efficacy of fungal isolates/strains  as initial trajectory for  initiating bio-pesticides development. The LC50 is a virulence index that determines the concentration that is needed to kill 50% of the target pest while LT50 show the time needed to kill 50% of the target pest under laboratory conditions. Similarly predator or parasitoids will be combined to determine synergy or antagonistic effects in the management of insect pest which depicts a real situation that operates under natural settings.      \r\n\r\nObjective 4 :To establish a biological control unit with research and enterprising   facilities.\r\nThe establishment for biological control facility with equipped laboratory facilities will provide both research and commercial activities in collaboration with private and public sector respectively. Students will be capacitated to specialize in biological control, and natural enemies will be  reared for  commercialize as  biocontrol agents, the facility will provide capacity building of smallholder farmers pest management officials  and collaboration with relevant stakeholders  in  developing policies for effective pest management strategies.     \r\n', ' This project will change the dynamics of pest management using natural enemies mainly predators , parasitoids and entomo-pathogenic fungi which involves\r\nï‚§	the collection and identification of the key pest and associated natural enemies. The collection of the pests will be carried out in the two main season - the rainy and wet season to determine their distribution pattern. The identified species will provide insight to efficiently design a control strategy at a particular point in time. \r\nï‚§	The biology of the pest and natural enemy will be investigated under laboratory conditions to determine population dynamics of the pests and investigate environmental cues that can trigger their fluctuations during peak period and their dormancy during off-season. The functional and numerical response of the natural enemies which predict their relevance as ideal biological control candidates. This information will provide insight for mass rearing of the natural enemies for commercialization and management of pests. \r\nï‚§	The identification of fungal sources, their isolation and characterization are initial steps for bio-pesticide development. The development of myco-insecticides can provide large scale protection  of agricultural pests as only small dosage is needed since the  fungal spores can spread diseases known (epizootics) in the insect population with a tendency exponentially increase its effect  The infected cadavers can also be used as  source of inoculum for processing  bio-pesticides on a sustainable basis \r\nï‚§	The establishment of biological control unit with enhanced facilities will promote large management of insect pests at the same time maintain the integrity of the environment. This objective involves establishment of biocontrol laboratory having requisite equipment for such service. The unit will expect to capacitate pest management personnel , platform  of collaboration and production of natural enemies and bio-pesticides for commercial purposes .       \r\n', 'Pest management efforts  are dominated with use synthetic chemical pesticides with dire consequences of environmental degradation, secondary pest out breaks , pest resurgence to name but a few . As most smallholder farmers cannot afford the exorbitant cost of these pesticides , their farms are always subjected to biotic pressure of insects with devastating consequences. The establishment of biological control unit  will provide the opportunity to mass rear natural enemies and also develop bio-pesticides that  can sustain large scale pest management efforts without tampering the integrity of the environment. Entomo-pathogenic fungi contain bioactive ingredient the spores which are highly virulent to insect pests which can be extracted and use as bio-pesticides. The use of these bio-pesticides , predators and parasitoids can be easily obtained and harness with commercial basis that can attract private and public sector with highly acclaimed values .\r\n\r\n', 'The use of biological control agents such as predatory beetles and parasitic wasps have proved to effect management of insect pests with outstanding outcomes. Similarly the use of entomo-pathogenic fungi such as Metarhizium species to develop a biopesticide known as Green Muscle has proven  quite efficient in the management of chewing and sap sucking insects pest  without  environmental degradation. As our environments are well endowed with these organism, the feasibility of exploiting them and harness them as efficient biocontrol agents can be realized. The mass realizing and utilization of natural enemies has three main strategies viz i)  inoculation of agroecosystem with these organisms can build up their population through production of more offsprings that go in search of insect population. A typical prototype is the predatory ladybird  beetles  Coleoptera : Coccinellidae feed on all immatures stages of sap sucking insects like thrips and whiteflies , have high mobility and reproductive capability with high intrinsic rate of growth that overcome pest population . Population of these beetles and many other natural enemies in wasp categories are common in vegetable gardens and orchards  in Sierra Leone. ', 'The subject of biological control requires the inputs of relevant stakeholders namely ecologist, taxonomist, mycologist , population modelling experts , extension and social work experts and tissue culture experts and more importantly entomologist.    \r\nï‚§	The entomologist is quite crucial as he occupies the central stage as he provides the scientific knowledge to determine the biological attributes of both the pests and natural enemies. Most of the natural enemies belong to insect orders and families, and a scientific knowledge of entomologist will provide added value to the success of the project as he has the ability to evaluate the efficacy of the natural enemy more specifically. \r\nï‚§	The taxonomist will add value to this project by identifying the various taxa of the insect collected particularly when a new species is collected. The taxonomic description will provide new knowledge on the existence of the pest which will be of interest to the scientific audience. \r\nEcologist will play a role to provide information on the modelling and fore casting the population dynamics to help understand potential outbreak, the host-insect-natural enemy complex a better pest management design \r\nThe mycologist can help the isolation of fungal spores and their characterization alongside with tissue culture experts for development of bio-pesticides. \r\nExtension service and social work can help dissemination information to smallholder farmer, educate them on the relevance and help them to adopt the innovation.  \r\n', 'This project has tendency to harnessing and exploitation of natural enemies (predators, parasitoids and entomo-pathogenic fungi  requires  research and scientific inputs while development of bio-pesticides needs both scientific knowledge and investment. The harness and exploitation of natural enemies will require the collaboration most specifically the service of consultants and potential investor who are interested in biopesticides .

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\r\nSierra Leone lies on the southwest coast of West Africa, a typical tropical region characterized by plenty sunshine and heavy rainfall. Its 71,740 km2 land area is 60% undulating, giving rise to dense patches of valley bottom marshlands called Inland Valley Swamp (IVS). There are strips of lowlands along the sea cost called mangrove swamps that are also marshy (WB-SL, 2023). These forms of landscape collectively account for about 5% of the total land area of the country. The other ecologies such as the bolilands (vast flat lands that become marshy during the rains and dry during the dries), hills and mountains (Leipzig, 1996) that are also part of the landscape of Sierra Leone.\r\nApproximately 58% of the land area of Sierra Leone is fit for agriculture and while 20% of this fraction is arable, only 15% of the arable land is cultivated (BEFS, 2013). Even so, 65% of the 9 million people in Sierra Leone toil the soil for livelihood (WFB, 2023). This makes agriculture by far the dominant sector of the Sierra Leone economy, accounting for 48% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and some 10% of the export earnings.\r\nSettlements as villages, towns and cities account for about 6% of the land area and the respective fractions that are urban and rural settlements are not known. Although rural dwellings account for over 60% of the settlements, urban settlements as towns and cities are home to some 43% of the population of Sierra Leone (SLPC, 2023).\r\nThe fraction of urban area that is under marshland (as IVS, mangrove swamp and floodplain) is also not so investigated, but estimated at 10%. Although small, this form of land holds a great importance in terms of crop production for direct consumption of the urban population. So very many different types of food crops are cultivated in these urban wetlands, including rice, maize, cassava, potato and vegetables of different kinds â€” root, stem, leaf and fruit vegetables. These swamps also serve as feeding grounds for so many animals that are under the free-range system; by far the most common mode of livestock rearing in Sierra Leone. Swamps also naturally host plenty of aquatic animals like fish, crabs, shrimps and reptiles, which serve as a cheap source of protein that is virtually free for harvesting. As a form of wetland, swamps provide many ecological services, including holding runoff water, providing habitat for biodiversity, feeding ground for varieties of animals, etc.\r\nIn spite of providing vital ecological services, swamp ecosystems are increasing being impaired by urban solid waste deposition, including gravel, plastic, tin, glass, other debris, etc. This is because on the one hand, urban areas have the most paved land surfaces and unpaved barelands in the country â€” making it highly prone to runoff and erosion. With climate change on the other hand, a degree of unprecedented flooding is occurring in urban wetlands. The frequency, intensity and spread of the floods are alarmingly too, causing huge destructions to urban agriculture, life and property and to ecological services. As flood damage is increasing year in and out, Disaster Preparedness and Response (DPR) activities (of both governmental and non-governmental organizations) are being intensified around the country. While DPR is excellent enough in mitigating the effect of flooding on urban agriculture, a more robust and sustainable ways for fixing these unfortunate events is through climate-smart and climate-resilient strategies. The perfect mix of DPR and climate-smart/resilient strategies has the potential to first of all mitigate and/or reverse global warming and then climate change It can also reduce the risk of flooding that is the effect of climate change.\r\nIt is decades past when the concept of â€œgreen cityâ€ (city in balance with nature) first emerged (Breuste, 1994) and this has hardly materialized since, especially in developing countries like Sierra Leone. It was with global warming that the concept of â€œgreen cityâ€ sprang up and it is with climate change that this concept should now be implemented with an unprecedented robustness and sustainability (Breuste, 2020). While the failure to do this could have far-reaching consequences on the diet, life and property of especially the urban population, the benefits of doing it are huge. It is good for global warming and climate change, flooding and disaster, life and property, diet and food, aesthetic and recreation, etc. This research will once again make the case for a functional urban planning in Sierra Leone and make urban dwelling largely safe. It will retrigger active urban research as a way of fixing the tight and crowded outlooks of the urban settlements in Sierra Leone. This research will also build private sector confidence to invest in urban planning, construction, and disaster management and prevention.\r\n2.	PROJECT STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS\r\nWhy urban agriculture has been a significant part of urban food supply, it has hardly gained the support it deserves. The emphasis has been infrastructural development in urban areas, not agriculture. With the worsening effects of the ongoing global warming and the resulting climate change, the frequency, intensity and spread of flooding in urban areas are simply unprecedented. This threatens the already under-attended agriculture in urban areas, where also over 40% of the population dwells. Thus, the key question here is, when will urban agriculture be given the desired attention? This requires research into the role of urban agriculture in urban life and the protection of it to enhance productivity. This, in fact, has never more so urgent than now, when global warming and climate change are resulting in unprecedented damages around the world, including in urban environments. Even the cities perceived to be most secured in the world are being challenged like never before, like recently seen in New York, United States of America (USA). This is the key concern that this project will attempt to address.\r\n3.	PROJECT GOAL AND SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\nGoing it all in large-scale farms could respond to the â€œFeed-Saloneâ€ drive for food self-sufficiency and food security, but not in the richness as it would be in combination with small-scale urban agriculture. This is because agriculture in the swamps, wetlands or marshlands in urban environment hugely complements vegetable production in the country. The controlled deposition of solid wastes in these wetlands sufficiently enriches the soils with the nutrients required for optimal crop productivity. The goal of this research is to protect and develop this potential to the fullest capacity to make urban areas a vital crop production base in Sierra Leone. This is key because a large proportion of the vegetables cultivated are consumed by urban dwellers. With production in the same area where consumption occurs, there can be huge savings from transportation and storage.\r\nThus, the specific objectives of the research are to:\r\ni).	Determine the role of urban agriculture in urban lives and livelihoods;\r\nii).	Identify and delineate wetlands (marshland and swamp) and waterways in urban Sierra Leone;\r\niii).	Plan and design a climate-smart and climate-resilient strategy that can effectively control flooding in urban Sierra Leone;\r\niv).	Improve the aesthetics and provide recreation and relaxation for urban dwellers in Sierra Leone;\r\nv).	Prevent and control flood-related damages to agriculture, and life and property in urban areas in Sierra Leone; and open up doors for future studies about green cities and urbanization in Sierra Leone.', 'With deepening climate change, the frequency, intensity and spread of flooding are increasing with disproportionate damage to agriculture, and life and property.

The implementation of the climate-smart/climate-resilient green city will have countless benefits, including enhancement of productivity of crops, fishes, biodiversity and ecological services of urban IVS/wetlands.', 'There is hardly any data on urban agriculture in Sierra Leone and the most of West Africa. With the worsening climate change and its effects, there is need to set this clear, develop protection and improvement measures to increase its contribution to food security and balanced diet intake. The lack of conclusive studies on this sector of the agriculture makes this project novel and relevant. The expectation is that at the end of the project, sufficient awareness will have been raised on urban agriculture backed by solid data. There will then be a clear pathway to follow regarding the protection and productivity of urban agriculture. Irrespectively, using climate-smart strategies by way of developing buffer zone of ecological forests around wetlands and waterways in urban areas is so very much beneficial for everything, flood mitigation, life/property safety, disease vector destruction, aesthetic services, recreational services, biodiversity services, ecological services, revenue generation, etc.', 'Backyard gardening is a culture of Sierra Leone, which is actually an individual/private venture. The concept of urban agriculture will now take this culture from the backyard to the public place where everyone can benefit. Doing so with climate-smart considerations makes it even more sustainable in the face of climate change. This concept is not too distant from that of â€œgreen cityâ€, which the most of Africa has since missed out. So, the project is practical and doable as it takes considerably from the â€˜green cityâ€™ concept.', 'The formation of the consortium of researchers involved in this project is very telling of the interdisciplinarity of the project. Mitigating flood damage to urban agriculture using climate-smart strategies is not about agriculture alone, but also such other disciplines like hydrology, geography, computer science, remote sensing, ao many others. ', 'Although this project is developed by a consortium of researchers who are in Njal University, its implementation involves people with much wider background. It requires collaboration with local government authorities in the areas of implementation, land owners within the project area and the local communities at large. This justifies the several rounds of stakeholder meetings, seminars and workshops in the pre- implementation, implementation and post- implementation phases of the project.', 'As already detailed in the project proposal, the relevance and importance of the project lies in the benefits gained by implementing the project and the risks posed by not implementing it at all.', 'No', '', 1, 1),

In the proposed study, it is expected that communities and houses which are prone to mosquito invasion are predicted precisely, so that preliminary vector control countermeasures will be identified and implemented.', '\r\nOver the years, various strategies have been implemented to eliminate malaria disease (Fombah et al., 2023; Ishizumi et al., 2021; McCoy et al., 2021). The strategies include using insecticide-treated bed nets and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS). Despite these interventions, the malaria situation remains dire in Sierra Leone. Furthermore, the implementation of larval source management (LSM) has been undertaken. However, due to budget constraints for vector controls, the number of districts where IRS has been implemented is limited, and there is no budget identified for LSM.\r\nSierra Leone has a long history of experiences with the mosquito-borne diseases centered on malaria. Despite the huge progress toward malaria elimination in the last decades, Sierra Leone has been ranked among the highest malaria-endemic countries globally, with over 7.5 million at risk of malaria infection(Koroma et al., 2022) and malaria being the leading cause of death in most age groups (Carshon-Marsh et al., 2021). This burden has a significant economic impact on the country, leading to decreased productivity and increased healthcare costs. The transmission of malaria in Sierra Leone is high as the country has the climatic conditions for mosquito breeding. The hot, humid climate and inadequate sanitation and water supply provide ideal breeding grounds for the two main species of malaria-carrying mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus). Additionally, most people in Sierra Leone do not appropriately utilize  mosquito nets, and have less access to environmental control programs such as mosquito fumigation or insecticides, and preventative medications (Ansumana et al., 2020; Koroma et al., 2022).\r\nOver the years, various strategies have been implemented to eliminate malaria disease(Fombah et al., 2023; Ishizumi et al., 2021; McCoy et al., 2021).

Remote-sensing technologies have already been utilized in public health and can provide valuable insights by enabling monitoring of environmental factors, disease vectors, and population movements. This technology helps predict disease outbreaks, assist in planning health interventions, and enable public health professionals to respond to emergencies in a timely manner..\r\nIn particular, Sierra Leone has been one of the countries with the most suitable situation for drone technology. In 2019, the government of Sierra Leone, UNICEF, and Njala University jointly launched a drone corridor to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery. The drone corridor is a designated airspace for testing various drone solutions, including medical deliveries, emergency responses, and geospatial mapping. The Sierra Leonean government, in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Authority and the Directorate of Science Technology and Innovation (DSTI), is working on a regulatory framework to enable the use of drones for maximizing societal impacts. Njala University has committed land to the corridor, allowing researchers and students to gain experience in drone technology.\r\n\r\n3.

Malaria is the leading cause of mortality among infants under 5 years of age and accounts for almost half of all outpatient cases of all ages, putting strong pressure on the country\'s healthcare system and financial base. The Government of Sierra Leone has continued to invest heavily in malaria control following the Sierra Leone National Malaria Elimination Strategic Plan. The country has made tremendous strides to delineate the efforts required to control the impact of malaria among its citizens, and the number of malaria cases and deaths are declining at appreciable rates. However, the strong reliance on international donors and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have created significant financial sustainability challenges, and the government now encourages cost-effective interventions to mitigate against the effects of malaria. \r\nAlso, there is growing concern that climate changes have huge influences on the ecology of mosquitoes. A serious problem in the African continent is the threat of Anopheles Stephensi, which was initially identified with Asia but recently confirmed to be in Western African countries, such as Nigeria and Ghana.

(20, 29, 26, 'Man has been using fire for thousands of years to cook and provide warmth. Studies have shown that, transfer of heat to raw food and cold water is essential for healthier living and taste improvement. The popular wonder stove, which uses charcoal as fuel, is used by most homes in Freetown and big cities in Sierra Leone, while the three stone fire, used widely in rural settings, utilises wood as fuel. Thus, both wonder stove and three-stone fire use biomass, which is a renewable fuel. However, hundreds of trees are cut down yearly to produce charcoal, and there are concerns about such production on human health and environment pollution. Wonder stove is more efficient than three stone fire, however, its design makes it difficult to use other forms of fuels. Also, when this stove runs low on fuel, the pot has to be removed for refuelling, thereby increasing cooking time and efforts. \r\n\r\nIn Sierra Leone, it is widely believed that wonder stove is the best for cooking and heating as it emits little or no smoke. This perception seems to be true, superficially. Closer investigation will reveal that it takes more time to ignite and perform cooking tasks, leading to more fuel consumption. Numerous studies on cookstove have revealed that improved cookstoves are more efficient in terms of fuel consumption and cooking time. This study will be undertaken to address these concerns by designing and fabricating a cook stove with better thermal efficiency, less fuel consumption and less environmental pollutions.\r\n\r\n', 'A major challenge faced by one-third of the global population is access to clean forms of energy for cooking (WHO, 2021). These people mainly reside in developing countries, including Sierra Leone, and they use biomass stoves for cooking and heating (IEA, 2022). Every year about 4 million premature deaths occur from illnesses resulting from household air pollution due to inefficient cooking practices (who, 2022). Studies have shown that improved cook stoves are more efficient in fuel consumption and emit less pollutants than traditional forms of cooking. \r\nDifferent forms of cookstoves have been designed and fabricated across the globe to address energy efficiency and reduction in emission pollutions (Miandad et al., 2019; Das et al., 2021). Ahmad et al. (2022) found out that, compared to traditional three-stone fire place, improved cook stoves (ICS) have better thermal efï¬ciency, lesser emissions with lower health risks.\r\n      Wonder stove is prevalently used for cooking and heating in big cities of Sierra Leone, especially the capital city, Freetown, and its environs. The stove uses charcoal as fuel, and hundreds of trees are cut down yearly to meet demand, leading to concerns on sustainably and the environment (IEA, 2022). Most Sierra Leoneans believe that wonder stove is the best for cooking as it emits little smoke. At first glance, these perceptions seem to be true. However, these claims fail to take into account ignition and cooking durations, including fuel consumption. Wonder stove takes longer time to ignite and its thermal efficiency is below that of improved cook stoves, and in essence, it takes more time to perform a cooking task (Kalbande et al., 2017). Furthermore, clay is used to make the combustion chambers of this stove (Chiu, 2023), which is mined at an alarming rate as hundreds of these chambers are made, weekly, to meet demand of customers. A continuation of this trend would pose sustainability issues of this material. Also, these clay mining sites become breathing ground for mosquitoes, an ensuing health issue for residents around the site. Therefore, once users start to rethink their perceptions towards these concerns, solutions to these problems can be provided.\r\n      Several studies have been done by various scholars (Geller, 1982; Anderson, 2007; Zube, 2010; Sutar, 2022; Shah et al., 2023) on the effectiveness of cook stove but none was specific on relationship between performance and principles and processes of design that would lead to continuous operation using diverse solid biomass fuel. Therefore, a solution is required that is sustainable, cheaper with potential for commercialisation. In this regard, a problem statement question is posed:  what is the relationship between performance of a stove and its design principles and processes? The purpose of this study will be to produce a stove that runs continuously and proficient in using diverse solid biomass fuels. A stove with such attributes is expected to emit less pollutants and attract private sector participation that would lead to job creation. However, there are factors expected to influence performance, and this study will investigate such factors. Ultimately, this study is expected to provide solutions to the problems highlighted and to achieve the purpose of this study. Additionally, the review has shown that the use of improved cookstoves can lead to less fuel usage leading to a reduction in environmental pollution as less trees are cut down. Nevertheless, there is need for further improvement in the form of: ease of use, combination of fuel feed methods, thermal efficiency and environmental pollution. However, reviewed literatures hardly reveal studies that have combined both rocket and TLUD principles in cookstove design and production, especially in Sierra Leone. So, this study is expected to come up with a design that is capable of addressing these challenges.\r\n\r\nAim and objectives\r\nConsultation with academic experts, business entrepreneurs and review of existing literature in this field of study, resulted in raising five research questions and they are:\r\nI.	Can moisture content of fuel affect thermal properties of the stove?\r\nII.	Is there a relationship between design principles and processes adopted and performance?\r\nIII.	What are the consequences on the users and the environment as a result of using diverse biomass fuels on the stove?\r\nIV.	What are the results of continuous operation of the stove?\r\nV.	Can a sustainable business venture be derived from the production of the stove?\r\nVI.	What are the effects on users and the environment as a result of using the stove?\r\n\r\nIn order to provide answers to these research questions, objectives need to be constructed, based on the goal of the study. The goal of this study is: to produce a stove that is designed to run continuously and proficient in using diverse solid biomass fuels. Achievement of this goal is contingent on objectives designed for this purpose and they are:\r\nI.	To assess the effects of moisture content of fuel on the thermal properties of the stove\r\nII.	To evaluate the effects of design principles and processes on the performance of the stove\r\nIII.	To find out the effects of using different biomass fuels on the users and the environment \r\nIV.	To explore the possibility of operating the stove continuously\r\nV.	To determine whether a business venture can be derived from production of the stove \r\nVI.	To find out whether collaborate with the private sector can lead to sustainable and profitable business venture leading to job creation\r\nVII.	To identify the implications of using the stove on users and the environment\r\n\r\nTherefore, the achievement of these objectives will provide answers to the research questions leading to achievement of the goal of this study. This study will evaluate the effects of design principles and processes on performance of the stove. So, dependent and independent variables will be developed, wherein, design principles and processes is the independent variable, and performance of stove is the dependent variable. Therefore, performance will improve if design is made better.\r\n\r\nBurning solid biomass in biomass cookstoves converts chemical energy into thermal energy which provides useful heat for cooking and heating (Bushnell, 1987).  Heat transfer contribution and steady state energy balance is essential.  In cookstove design,  total heat gain (32.1%) are those from convection and radiation, 17.5% and 14.6% respectively, whereas total heat loss is 67.8%. this value of heat loss is more than twice the heat gain. Furthermore, about a third (29%) of the energy produced is wasted. radiation heat losses account for 19% of heat loss (Zube, 2010).  Therefore, reduction of these losses is one of the objectives of this proposed study.\r\n     \r\nThere are several different types of improved cookstoves, for example, rocket elbow and top lift up draft (TLUD), (Anderson (2007). The rocket elbow stove works on continuous feeding of fuel, leading to more tending time while the TLUD stove is considered a gasifier and, smoke is prevented during cooking when no fuel is added (Bryden, 2010). Compared to the traditional three-stone fire stove, improved cookstoves are portable and can be used both indoors and outdoors, hence, they should be carefully designed to achieve better thermal efficiency (Zube, 2010). Researchers such as Geller (1982), Anderson (2007) and Verhaart (1982) focused on improvement on the structure of the combustion chamber and distance between the end of the stove and bottom of pot, as these factors are essential for better heat transfer. The proposed design of the stove for this study makes use of both rocket and TLUD  principles of burning solid biomass fuel to generate heat. It is important to note that efficiency of improved cookstoves do not always lead to reduced emissions. Some researchers have shown a positive correlation between efficiency and emission (Bhattacharya and Salam, 2002). However, when compared with traditional biomass cookstoves, improved biomass cookstoves are found to be more efficient, for they consume less fuel, 20 â€“ 50% (Mukunda et al., 1988). Recent studies have shown that improved cookstoves are more efficient than traditional three stone fire stoves (Parajuli et al., 2019; Gumino et al., 2020; Mekonnen, 2020; Sutar, 2022). Rocket elbow stoves tests results, when compared to TSF, show a reduction in fuel saving of 41% with a reduction in CO and pm25 by 46% and 56% respectively (Anderson, 2007). \r\n\r\n', 'Clean cooking technology is a continuous process that has led to design of several types of energy-saving cookstoves for both rural and urban dwellers in developing countries, including Sierra Leone.  Rocket and Top-lit up-draft (TLUD) micro-gasifier stove designs have resulted in reduction of harmful emissions from solid biomass fuel combustion, and such stoves are based on an improved combustion technology with better efficiency, consumes less fuels and emits less CO when compared to traditional cook stoves. Therefore, by replacing traditional cook stoves, like three-stone fires, with improved cook stoves, can result in appreciable environmental, health and commercial benefits. Accordingly, a solution is required that is sustainable, cheaper with potential for commercialisation. Thus, a relationship between performance of a stove and its design principles and processes need to be investigated. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this study will be to produce a stove that runs continuously and proficient in using diverse solid biomass fuels. A stove with such attributes is expected to emit less pollutants and attract private sector participation that would lead to job creation. \r\nHowever, there are factors expected to influence performance and uptake of such stove, such as cost, perception of uses and cultural settings, and this study will investigate such factors. In this regard, production of a cooking and heating stove that uses locally available knowledge, skills and materials, leading to better fuel efficiency, is urgently required. ', ' Reviewed literature has shown that the use of improved cookstoves can lead to less fuel usage leading to a reduction in environmental pollution as less trees are cut down. Nevertheless, there is need for further improvement in the form of: ease of use, combination of fuel feed methods, thermal efficiency and environmental pollution. However, reviewed literatures hardly reveal studies that have combined both rocket and TLUD principles in cookstove design and production, especially in Sierra Leone.  Therefore, there is a gap in the literature. So, this study is expected to come up with a design that is capable of addressing these challenges.\r\n\r\nThe design will be based on two principles, rocket and TLUD which are more efficient than traditional cookstoves. The rocket principle works on burning biomass placed at 90 degrees to the combustion chamber to produce heat, whilst the TLUD burns fuel placed in parallel to its combustion chamber, thereby, burning gasses from the biomass through a thermos-chemical reactions called gasification and pyrolysis. ', 'The purpose of this study will be to produce a stove that runs continuously and proficient in using diverse solid biomass fuels.  A stove with such attributes is expected to emit less pollutants and attract private sector participation that would lead to job creation. However, there are factors expected to influence performance, and this study will investigate such factors. Ultimately, this study is expected to provide solutions to the problems highlighted and to achieve the purpose of this study. Additionally,  two prototypes were designed and fabricated. Results revealed that, when compared to three-stone fire and wonder stove, these stoves consumes less biomass fuel, emits less pollutants with better thermal efficiencies.', 'These innovative designs are meant to be used for cooking and heating in domestic settings, and for drying raw fish and to parch gari, carbohydrate food made from cassava grits, consumed in most West African countries, including Sierra Leone,  for commercially purposes.  Additionally, a steam turbine fitted with an electric armature can also be placed on the stove to produce electricity.  These heat transfer innovative designs will provide jobs and  help address issues of deforestation and poor health. These designs will, therefore, involve different  fields of study such as, mechanical, environmental, civil, electrical and electronics,  industrial engineering , marketing, management accounting and economics.', 'A product can be technically sound but is may not necessarily address the needs of users. Therefore, a balance will be struck between outcome and output to ensure the product is both practical and functional thereby leading to customer satisfaction and eventual product success. Private sector partners and students will be encouraged to focus on outcome of design by thinking creatively resulting in innovative and sustainable solutions to existing problems. It is expected to build capacity in communities and potential business organisations thereby transferring a range of knowledge and skills to participants with the aim of pursuing new development opportunities. This runs parallel to the human development perspective of the government. ', 'Design is expected to lead to less fuel use, which will lead to lower deforestation as less trees are cut down thereby helping to address the issue of climate change. Design is expected to use less fuel, therefore women and children will spend less time collecting fire wood, resulting in availability of more time for schooling and other forms of education. As the stove is expected to produce less pollutants, health of workers that are directly involved in gari and fish drying will improve, for less pollutants are inhaled as compared to traditional drying methods. As less fuel is expected to be used, fish and gari producers are expected to make more profit. The research will provide additional benefits to the community such as jobs and decreased dependency on charcoal. Short-term employment such as computer aided design (CAD) technicians and metal workers, will be created during design and production of the stove whereas long-term employment is expected to be incremental which will result after the project is completed as potential business entrepreneurs will be involved.

', 'Sierra Leone, characterized by its predominantly agrarian economy, faces challenges in its agricultural sector that hinder sustainable development ((FAO, 2022).  Despite the importance of agriculture to the livelihoods of a significant portion of the population, rural farmers often grapple with limited access to timely information, inadequate extension services, and traditional farming practices that may not be optimized for productivity and resource efficiency (Rubio et al., 2018). \r\n\r\nThe existing gap in information accessibility, coupled with the need for modern, data-driven agricultural practices, presents an opportunity for innovative solutions to uplift the farming community. Recognizing this, the Smart Extension System project aims to leverage technology to bridge these gaps, empower farmers, and contribute to the overall advancement of Sierra Leone\'s agriculture. Smallholder farmers lack access to real-time information on climate-smart practices, market prices, and best agricultural practices (Rhodes, 2018). The traditional extension services struggle to reach all farmers, limiting the dissemination of knowledge and personalized support (GoSL, 2017). The team is well- grounded with empirical data on these existing challenges within Sierra Leone\'s agriculture. The rationale lies in utilizing technology to address these challenges, empowering farmers, fostering community collaboration, and contributing to sustainable agricultural development in Sierra Leone. The project will develop an innovative agricultural technology-driven extension mobile application called â€œFarmConnectâ€.

Recent estimates of the global burden of fungal infections show a substantial burden (Vallabhaneni et al., 2016). However, data on fungal infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are scarce due to limited human resources and diagnostic capacity to detect, manage, and prevent fungal infections, including chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA).\r\nThe WHO annual report on tuberculosis (TB) identifies approximately 45% of pulmonary tuberculosis patients with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis (smear/Xpert negative) (WHO 2020). As a result, many people were treated for TB without evidence of the disease. The most common misdiagnosis is CPA, which leads to considerable morbidity and unnecessary mortality. \r\nCPA can mimic TB, can occur during 6 months of TB treatment, or can occur after TB, mainly in those who are left with cavities (Ade et al. 2013). A global prevalence estimate of CPA after TB based on 2005 TB data, indicated ~1.2 million people are affected (Denning et al.  2011). A study from Iran found 6% to have CPA in the first episode of TB in the 12 months since diagnosis (Hedayati et al. 2015). Recent studies from Indonesia found that 13% of patients had CPA after 6 months of anti-TB therapy (Setianingrum et al., 2020).\r\nThere is no comprehensive estimate in sub-Saharan Africa of the number of mistaken diagnoses of TB when the diagnosis was actually CPA. A prospective longitudinal study in the North of Uganda found that 6.5% of those with a cavity 2-7 years after TB developed CPA each year (Page et al. 2019). A study from Nigeria found that 19% of smear/Xpert-negative people had CPA (Oladele et al. 2017). \r\nSierra Leone is among the top 30 high TB burden countries in the world with 24,000 cases (298 TB cases per 100,000 population) (WHO 2020). In our recent study, nearly 50% of patients treated for TB in the national referral hospital in Sierra Leone were clinically diagnosed (Lakoh et al. 2019). Despite this and the fact that CPA is probably the main cause of their symptoms, there is limited data on the burden of this disease among patients with respiratory symptoms in Sierra Leone owing to the limited human resource and diagnostic capacity for the detection, management, and prevention of these fungal infections. \r\n\r\n RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS \r\nThe goal of the ePARSLE project is to strengthen the detection and management of CPA among patients with respiratory diseases in the national referral and regional hospitals in Sierra Leone. \r\nSpecifically, between March 2024 and September 2025, the project will: \r\nDetermine what proportion of patients with â€˜smear/Xpert negativeâ€™ TB or previously treated TB patients who apparently relapse with new symptoms has CPA. We hypothesize that there is a high prevalence of CPA among patients with â€˜smear/Xpert negativeâ€™ TB or previously treated TB patients who apparently relapse with new symptoms. The output for this objective is a manuscript on the prevalence and risk factors for CPA among patients with â€˜smear/Xpert negativeâ€™ TB.\r\nDevelop the capacity of clinicians and laboratory staff for the detection and management of CPA. We will train and mentor clinicians on the detection and management of CPA and train laboratory personnel in all 6 hospitals to undertake Aspergillus IgG/IgM lateral flow assay for Aspergillus antibody. We hypothesize that the baseline knowledge level of clinicians on CPA is very low, but that will be improved as we implement the ePARSLE project. We will deliver more advanced clinical management with a smaller group of senior clinicians. The outcome is that HCWs who are trained on CPA will be able to demonstrate good knowledge and practice of CPA after at least 50% of the project implementation compared to the baseline.

(23, 32, 88, 'The greatest challenge throughout history of Sierra Leone is for the country to feed its ever-increasing population on a permanent basis. Several initiatives and interventions have been pursued over the years but the yield still continues to be appalling. There is a wide gap between potential and actual yield of major crops due to poor cropping systems, inherent poor soil physical and chemical properties especially high soil acidity and associated low nutrient reserves. Hence, developing effective and efficient soil nutrient management models that are able to predict crop-nutrient relationships for Sierra Leone situation is indispensable for enhancing crop productivity and sustainable yield. This project seeks to test and validate crop and soil modelling tools such as DSSAT, APSIM and NuMaSS, which have been developed, tested and found useful for modelling cropping systems and nutrient relationships in similar agroecologies of the subregion. In savannah agro-ecologies of West Africa, DSSAT, APSIM and NuMaSS models have been accurately used to inform farmers, extension agents, researchers, and policy planners at the household level, community level, regional and national level, respectively on cropping systems and nutrient diagnosis and recommendations with existing soil nutrient management practices. In this project, Eastern Technical University of Sierra Leone (ETU-SL) intends to produce crop and soil simulation models to guide quality decision making and policy planning in climate smart agriculture, train farmers in interpreting crop and nutrient predictions and weather forecasts, and using these in deciding on timely agronomic practices such as optimal planting and weeding times, and also enhance the capacity of the University. The information generated will not only increase productivity and incomes along value chains but also offers more opportunities to system transformation and upgrading. The project will cover a period of two years, with a total cost of 44,840 USD.', 'The Sierra Leone agriculture is mainly subsistence and rainfed, which is characterized by low and variable rainfall, poor soils and pest and diseases. The soils cannot support crop production without addition of external amendments. The distribution of rainfall is becoming increasingly erratic over the growing season making investments into agriculture a risky venture. Emerging pests like Fall Army Worm (FAW) and diseases are also posing greater threats to crop production. Another major cause of low yield is the low quality of planting materials that are in use. Most of these varieties grown by farmers are low yielding and vulnerable to environmental and other abiotic stress factors. Over the years, national and international agricultural research institutes in the sub-region have developed crop production technologies that will help the farmers respond to the variability in climate change. For example, IITA has developed cowpea and maize varieties that combine tolerance to drought with resistance to parasitic weeds, Striga. They have also identified crop management practices such as optimal plant population, planting dates, fertilizer rates and types to close the maize and cowpea yield gap on farmersâ€™ fields in the several regions of West Africa. ICRISAT has also worked with national research centers to develop and test extensively groundnut, pearl millet and sorghum varieties along with soil and water management technologies for the semi-arid regions of West Africa. These technologies have however, been tested in only few locations. Hence, their performance can be considered to be site specific and cannot be extrapolated in wider areas. There is a wide variation in the soils and weather characteristics spatially in the different agroecologies of sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, the yield of any particular crop variety will depend on the nature of soil and topographical characteristics, rainfall distribution as well as other crop management practices. We are of the opinion that sound recommendations to farmers on appropriate varieties and management practices suitable for their specific location can only be adequately provided if long-term experiments are replicated over the entire region. This can be time consuming and very expensive. Cropping systems and soil management simulation models provide the opportunity to achieve these based on limited experimentation. Cropping systems simulation models such as DSSAT and APSIM, and soil management simulation models such as the Nutrient Management Support System (NuMaSS), which have been validated in the West African sub-region can be used to assess varietal responses to abiotic stresses and complimentary crop management practices as well as response to changes in climate. While DSSAT and APSIM models simulate the yield and growth of crops based on daily weather (minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and solar radiation), soil profile information, site information, and crop management practices on the one hand, NuMaSS on the other hand is a decision support system that diagnoses a nutrient deficiency in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and soil acidity, and recommends the best management methods. Users can compare diagnoses and economic implications of management recommendations across multiple scenarios of soils, crops, cultivars, and sources of lime and nutrients. Multiple scenarios enable the users to determine the consequences of their agronomic decisions and allow them to make better informed cropping system choices. We intend to work with diverse national institutions such as SLARI and Njala University to develop production domains for major crops grown in Sierra Leone using simulation models.', 'Activity 1.1.

By providing a protocol for testing and adapting NuMaSS to local conditions and households at several local communities, it will provide a methodology for scaling up from a few households to the hundreds of households which will never have an opportunity to be involved in participatory soil management technology testing and adoption. \r\no By developing a methodology to enhance adoption of improved soil management practices in the face of market constraints to farm profitability and affordability of inputs, the project will identify market constraints to farm profitability and to adoption of inputs and improved soil management practices. This will be done in the farmer decision making module, because each nutrient management decision model will contain constraints such as distance to market, cost and affordability of inputs, that usually constrain small farmers from adopting new nutrient-management technologies such as organic and inorganic fertilizer management. \r\no The nutrient management decision models in the farmer decision module will contain institutional and informational constraints (e.g., knowledge and riskiness of the nutrient management innovations) and will therefore help to identify human and institutional factors that block technology adoption, and enhance the availability and accessibility of information to support public policies that encourage adoption of sustainable crop production practices. \r\no Because the project will test and validate the adoption of NuMaSS recommendations by a variety of users at all levels of the information continuum (i.e., farmers, extension agents, and researchers and policy planners), it will solve the problem of ineffective transfer of soil management technologies from research to decision makers.

Effective smart irrigation systems can transform agricultural food security by boosting crop yield especially in the dry season.\r\n', 'Sierra Leone experiences a monomodal rainfall pattern characterized by the wet season between May and September while the dry season lies between the months of November and April. Most farming activities occur during the rainy season as our agriculture is mostly rainfed. This means that during the dry season, crop production is drastically reduced due to the fact that  farmers are operating at a subsistence level and cannot afford sophisticated irrigation set up. In addition, this significantly limits the area under cultivation. \r\nThis inconsistency in crop production during the year adds to the food insecurity issues in the nation. Better and smarter irrigation can lead to greater crop yield, protection against certain weeds and diseases and more. Sierra Leonean farmers having access to a Smart Agricultural LoRaWAN Based System with all its associated benefits will help address the production gap. This system will allow farmers to â€œsmartlyâ€ utilize water as an agricultural resource in a sustainable manner. Notably, during the dry season, some areas in Sierra Leone experience drought.

However, groundnut production is constrained by various biophysical and socio-economic factors, such as climate variability, soil fertility, pests and diseases, market access, and management practices. Therefore, there is a need to optimize groundnut production systems under different scenarios and contexts. This study aims to model groundnut production using APSIM, a powerful and flexible tool that can simulate the interactions and outcomes of these factors at different scales, from field to farm to region. The study will conduct field experiments with different levels of inputs and management practices for groundnut production, and collect and analyze data on the agronomic, economic, and environmental indicators of groundnut production. The study will also compare and evaluate the performance and trade-offs of different groundnut production systems under low-, medium- and high-intensive scenarios, and identify and recommend the optimal groundnut production systems that can maximize productivity and profitability while minimizing resource use and environmental impact. The study will provide valuable insights and guidance for researchers, farmers, policy makers, and other stakeholders involved in the groundnut value chain.', 'Groundnut (Arachis Hypogaea L.) belongs to the genus Arachis and the family Leguminsae (ICRAST, 2009; Ntare et al., 2008). It is a significant oilseed and food crop, ranking 4th among the oilseed crops and 13th among the worldâ€™s important food crops. It is a nut that is affordable for everyone including the poor and is grown in a wide range of tropical and subtropical regions between latitudes 40Â°S and 40Â°N, under different agro-climatic zones where rainfall during the growing season exceeds 1000 mm. In Sierra Leone, groundnut is grown in almost all agroecologies mainly in the Bombali, Kambia, Moyamba and Tonkolili districts. It is largely cultivated on the uplands as a ranfed crop and at small scale in the lowlands (IVS, Bolilands, and riverine grasslands) in the dry season under irrigation. However, the Uplands provide a better production environment for groundnut (Tarawali, 2014). \r\n\r\nGroundnut is an important source of edible oil and easily digestible protein (26-28%) as well as about half of the essential vitamins and about a third of the essential minerals required for human nutritional security and growth (Taru et al., 2008; Multipurpose Groundnut Feb 2009). It is consumed in different ways in Sierra Leone: raw nuts, boiled fresh pods, roasted nuts, groundnut cakes, or pounded into a paste (or peanut butter) which is used in preparing various types of soups. \r\n\r\nGroundnut is the most important and widely cultivated grain legume in Sierra Leone (MAFFS, 2005) providing food, feed, and income for thousands of farmers in the country. Despite its important role in nutritional security and income generation, groundnut production remains low in the country. Groundnut production in Sierra Leone is challenged by several biotic and abiotic factors, including drought, low soil fertility, insect pests and diseases, aflatoxin contamination leading to low yields and low economic returns (profit) to the farmer. Though the average yield of groundnut in the world is around 1.3t/ha, the average yield in Sierra Leone is reported at an average of 0.2t/ha (MAFFS, 2005). A recent report from Rural Health Care Initiative (RHCI) groundnut production programme indicated that improvement in groundnut technology yielded 1.08t/ha, which is about 4 times greater than estimates for local varieties grown by local farmers (RHCI, 2021). \r\n\r\nIn the past two decades, groundnut farmers in Sierra Leone have shifted from the traditional practice of cultivating a single cropping phase in the uplands during the rainy season (May-October) to a double cropping phase involving sowing a second crop in September after harvesting the first crop (Sesay and Yama, 1996). This provides a huge potential for farmers to enhance productivity and profitability of the groundnut cropping systems in Sierra Leone. With adequate irrigation facilities, a third cropping phase can be incorporated during the dry season to the benefit of farmers and improvement of the overall productivity of groundnut cropping systems in Sierra Leone. However, the benefits from such production systems can only be realized after a careful study and full understanding of the complex production environment in Sierra Leone to provide viable options for sustainable and profitable groundnut production.\r\n\r\nA report by Zeiba (2016) on yield expectations and efficiencies in Sierra Leone describes the complexity of the agricultural production system which is engulfed in a myriad of challenges to profitable crop production, ranging from climatic, soil and crop management, crop protection, postharvest, to socioeconomic conditions. The report suggested that crop production in Sierra Leone should not be modelled on the examples of Western or other regionsâ€™ production systems. This calls for a nation-specific or site-specific studies to understand the complexity of the prevailing production system in Sierra Leone that will proffer better solutions to sustainability and profitability of crop production in Sierra Leone. This requires a systems approach that takes into consideration the biophysical, socio-economic, and institutional factors that affect the performance and sustainability of groundnut production in Sierra Leone. A systems approach can help to identify the interactions and trade-offs among different components of the cropping system, such as climate, soil, water, crop, pests, diseases, weeds, postharvest, inputs, outputs, markets, policies, and stakeholders and the establishment of sustainable and profitable production systems at different levels of input intensification (low, medium and high) based on scientifically and practically proven technologies suitable to the Sierra Leone agricultural production conditions. In addition, such an approach should incorporate the nutritional quality of groundnut to ensure a truly sustainable food system.  \r\n\r\nThe current challenges of groundnut production systems in Sierra Leone may get worse in future climate scenarios if efforts are not directed towards finding sustainable solutions. Finding solutions to these constraints through conventional research approaches is time-consuming and expensive. However, there are software tools such as crop simulation models that have been developed to allow scientists to decipher the complexity of the production system and simplify the choice of targeted interventions to maximize productivity and sustainability. One such tool is the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM). \r\n\r\nAPSIM is an internationally recognised software framework for modelling and simulating agricultural systems, such as crops, soils, climate and management practices (Holzworth et al., 2014). It consists of a set of modules that communicate with each other to simulate the biophysical processes in farming systems. The APSIM-Peanut module was built upon an original peanut simulation model developed by Hammer et al. (1995) with numerous improvements. Details about the module were described in Robertson et al. (2002), which evaluated the performance of APSIM in simulating the growth and development of several leguminous crops. It has been demonstrated to accurately simulate peanut phenology and yield information under diverse environments (Robertson et al. 2002; Chauhan 2010). In APSIM-Peanut, the peanut phenological development from sowing to maturity was divided into eleven phases, and the duration of each phase was determined by the thermal time (Robertson et al. 2002). The model has been validated against field data from various regions and has been applied to various research questions, such as climate change impacts, irrigation management and crop improvement. The APSIM-Peanut module can be used to explore the effects of different factors on groundnut production, resource management, food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation.\r\n\r\nResearch Goal: To redesign and model the groundnut production systems in Sierra Leone into different levels of sustainable intensification and profitability as options for adoption by different categories of the farming community.\r\nObjectives:\r\n(i)	To determine and characterize the main constraints and opportunities for improving groundnut yield\r\n(ii)	To generate data for optimizing productivity and profitability under low-, medium- and high-intensive groundnut production systems\r\n(iii)	To use the data generated in (ii) to calibrate the APSIM Peanut model \r\n(iv)	To evaluate the reliability of APSIM model to predict crop yields in selected farmersâ€™ fields\r\n(v)	To develop sustainable postharvest processing methods to improve groundnut seed yield and nutritional quality\r\n\r\n', 'Groundnut is a vital crop for food security, nutrition, and income generation in many developing countries.

The proposed study will seek to provide a means by which farmers can solve these problems using a flexible tool that can simulate the complex interactions among production factors and generate solutions that assist farmers in making choices directed at maximizing productivity and profitability. In this way, the farmer is assured of a set of management practices from production to post harvest that will result in good economic returns. Policy makers and environmentalist will also use this approach to monitor the production activities of agricultural enterprises to ensure that they do not only maximize profit but also maintain nutritional and environmental quality. Addressing the challenges to groundnut production using a system approach that will ensure good yield, profitability and nutritional quality will also ensure the health and safety of consumers in the society.

The participating Departments of these universities offer a unique blend of expertise in engineering, agronomy, soil science and environmental science, aligning perfectly with the interdisciplinary nature of the project. UJ boast a robust technical infrastructure while both USL and NU have a pool of highly qualified researchers with a proven track record in renewable energy and agricultural research. Leveraging these resources, the universities have previously spearheaded impactful initiatives in many areas of academic endeavour, showcasing a commitment to community outreach and development. These universities have, in the past, maintained strong connections with the private sector, ensuring active collaboration in project workshops and decision-making processes. This project harmonizes seamlessly with the overarching research strategy of both universities, which prioritizes innovative solutions to address local challenges, thereby reinforcing their status as ideal joint host institutions with the capacity to drive meaningful impact in Sierra Leone\'s agricultural landscape.', 'In June 2022 the University of Sierra Leone (USL) signed a research and teaching collaboration agreement with the University of Johannesburg (UJ) in South Africa. As part of this agreement the USL can access the state of the arts research facilities of the UJ with potential for exchange of knowledge, teaching staff travels and student exchanges. This project will be undertaken under this collaboration with UJ as an international partner to provide consulting expertise to the Sierra Leone based team.', 'Solid waste generation is a major source of concern for nations around the world due to their ever-increasing volumes and their impact on the environment including climate change. Global solid waste generation is expected to reach a volume of 2.59 billion tons by 2030 with a waste management business landscape worth $2.5 trillion. Some typical wastes are household waste, industrial waste and agricultural wastes including rice straws and husks, cassava and other vegetable peel wastes, waste chicken egg shells, palm kernel shells, etc. The increasing volumes of solid waste generation is due to the world population explosion, urbanization, industrialization, and ever-increasing agricultural activities. Although governments, environmentalists and other stakeholders have expressed grave concerns over the increasing volumes of solid wastes generation, no effective management or disposal solution has been proposed.\r\nManagement of solid wastes has been practiced only in the form of waste generation control techniques by industries, collection, storage, and disposal methods implemented by municipalities and in some cases processing into other by-products and/or reuse. These are seen as both too expensive and unsustainable for most developing countries where the most common disposal methods are discarding or burning in heaps which have severe impact on climate change. Control, conversion to other products, recycling and reuse is seldom practiced due to lack of technical capacity, financial means, and stakeholder support. Thus, this project proposes the development of a biogas plant for the conversion of municipal, industrial, and agricultural solid wastes to methane gas that can be proposed for cooking in a well-designed gas cooking stove. The Team will build and demonstrate this system in the eastern city of Kenema and the system will comprise of a biogas generation plant and a new model cooking stove that uses the generated gas also to be proposed as an effective alternative to other methods ', 'No', '', 0, 4);

(3, 10, 44, '4.1. Conceptual and theoretical framework \r\nThe project will adopt a multi-dimensional approach in ensuring scalability and sustainability of the innovation to enhance successful production, processing and marketing of vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizers by farmers in the target communities. The project will be implemented through a project life-cycle approach, commencing right from its inception to the development of a post-project roadmap for continued investments in vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizer production, processing and marketing beyond the life of the project. A combination of activities comprising of training and capacity building, technology demonstrations, cost-sharing by farmers for adoption of technology, mentoring community-led institutions and micro-enterprise, outreach, and convergence with government programs will form the bedrock foundation for continued uptake and upscaling of sustainable agriculture technologies in project communities. ETU-SL will further collaborate with government and non-governmental organizations to ensure scalability and sustainability of this environmentally friendly technology in future programs.\r\n4.2. Research Approach \r\nThe project is designed to follow a scientific inquiry and data generation. To achieve this focus, the following models will be used:\r\na.	Hub and Spoke Model: where farmers will be the key participants of the process, with two levels; Level 1) Master farmers and Level 2) General farmers. The Master farmers will serve as promoters of the vermicomposting technology and probably marketers of the vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizers produced by the general farmers, while the general farmers are those who will be connected to the Master farmers through market linkages. The project will ensure that all selected Master and General farmers contribute a share of the cost involved to register their Farmer Based Organizations (FBOs) with relevant institutions. Several participatory activities such as farmer field visits and farmer fairs will be organized to facilitate the working of this model. The FBOs will be linked with the governmentâ€™s agriculture insurance scheme to help them mitigate funding shortages. The farmers will be organized into small groups of 100 members to form FBOs and register them with relevant organizations as a way to harness resources and to create market linkages for their products. Each FBO will be facilitated to establish an executive that will serve as its coordinating body for a period of term not exceeding two years (but re-electable based on performance). Members of the executive will be trained to serve as Trainers of Trainers (TOTs) so that even after the project would have folded up, they will be able to train their members. In addition, they will also be trained and supported in project proposal writing so that they can write project proposals that would be funded by government and its development partners even after the end of this project.\r\nb.	Sustainability and scalability pathways\r\nâ€¢	Strengthening Community Ownership: The project will ensure to work in partnership with the farming community to encourage their willingness and active involvement in the successful implementation of the model itself. This will help to benefit the 2262 project beneficiaries beyond the life of the project. Even after the completion of the project, these groups will be able to carry out needs assessment and start income generating projects. This is an incentive to hold them together and champion other communal activities and needs. Income generating activities like selling of vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizers and harvest from crops are key to increasing individual farmerâ€™s per capita and this is in line with poverty reduction strategy that can help to commit members to uphold the projects. The proceeds will help in sustaining the intended ecologically sound projects. Moreover, there are community banks in a number of communities, which were established by Government and its development partners to give loans to farmer organizations in order to embark on agricultural projects. This mechanism can be exploited by the groups during and after the project.  \r\nâ€¢	Institutional strengthening: The FBOs will be encouraged and motivated to embark on small-scale agricultural production such as vegetable cultivation, as a way to earn additional income. Eastern Technical University of Sierra Leone will develop a Center of Excellence in Integrated Soil Health Management, which will provide expert advice and services to farmers on various aspects of soil health and fertility management on cost recovery basis to enhance productivity of crops and increase the incomes of farmers. This center will raise awareness on the benefit of applying vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizers using radio discussions. This will create business opportunities for organic fertilizers, and create jobs for university graduates, many of whom are currently unemployed. \r\nâ€¢	Community Contribution: As another step towards ensuring community participation and ownership, from the very beginning, the project will ensure that all selected Master and General farmers contribute a share of the cost involved to register their FBOs with the relevant institutions.\r\nâ€¢	Capacity Building: Throughout the project duration, we will engage farmers in regular hands-on trainings in different formats. Apart from regular on-site trainings related to field demonstrations, farmers will also be exposed to field visits to gain additional practical knowledge related to both existing and new practices in farming. Additionally, farmer fairs will also be organized to involve a large number of farmers during which the benefits and success stories of vermicomposting technology will be highlighted to non-project farmers. The farmers will undergo Training of Trainers (TOTs) programmes that will empower to train others farmers. All these will serve as a cross-learning platform for farmers and will enable scaling out of the technology and practices to neighbouring farmers and communities. The project will specifically focus on enhancing the capacity of the FBOs, who shall in turn, be imparting awareness and knowledge to its growing membership after the end of the project.\r\nThe knowledge and information imparted to the community is one thing that will be used to empower and encourage them to utilize the available resources in an inexhaustible way. This will let communities judiciously utilize resources during their lifetime and later handover to the future generations in first rate order. These skills will therefore make generations regard themselves as custodians of nature given resources and not consumers. The system used during knowledge transfer involves institutionalization where trained individual farmers are organized into groups and encouraged to manage their own operations. This will enable them establish formal leadership in their respective groups which is directly responsible for groupâ€™s running and linkages with other developmental networks and for information sharing. The groupsâ€™ members will be trained in all the skills relevant to all their undertakings to ensure building the communitiesâ€™ human capital. This will guarantee continuity and at the same time induce intra community knowledge and ideas transfer through schemes like Farmers Field Schools (FFS), Demonstration Plots and Exchange Visits.\r\nc.	Partnership: This pathway will ensure scaling-up of project interventions in the existing project areas (horizontal) as well as with organizations across value chains to scale-up through policy and other development sector players to other geographic locations (vertical).\r\nâ€¢	Horizontal: Through this partnership model, we will provide a platform to FBOs to benefit from multiple government incentives. This will enable them to continue to have access to the project-initiated interventions. A participatory approach will be adopted to ensure smooth facilitation and promotion of collective planning and implementation among the various FBOs to enable improved management of activities and work output. To ensure the continuation of scaling-out the vermicomposting technology in the project districts, the project will developed a three-step approach: First development of community-level scaling-out plans for all project communities, second, sharing of these plans along with a FBO membership scaling-up plans with key district government stakeholders (highlighting investment required, convergence potential, interventions to implement and government schemes that can be leveraged for convergence to achieve the targeted interventions during and after project closure), and third, conducting a district-level workshop with these stakeholders to seek feedback and to encourage them to participate in this activity in the near future.\r\nâ€¢	Vertical: Here, we aim to ensure that the vermicomposting practices are integrated into various schemes and programs of government and non-government agencies at the district and/or state level. These may include organizations such as Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), Agricultural Universities and locally relevant NGOs/ Local Councils. These linkages have potential for promoting the project interventions beyond the project areas. \r\nd.	Outreach: This approach highlights current communication efforts that aim at reaching out to a larger audience for sharing best practices, information, and success stories from the project. It also involves integrating learnings from the project into agricultural programmes and projects of MDAs and NGOs. The project will develop digital outreach and communication materials for external audiences such as a project webpage, articles, info-notes and blogs on Eastern Technical University of Sierra Leone website and publications which will be hosted on other websites. These will help to showcase the project activities to the general public and encourage further discussions on scaling-out the technology. Additionally, during the project period, the project team will make several presentations to external scientific audiences, NGOs as well as the private sector. These presentations will help to ignite interest about project interventions. Several communication materials in the form of signboards, waybill and handbill messages will be pasted at strategic locations to continuing informing farmers about the projectâ€™s intervention and benefits while also providing them with information.

(4, 13, 47, 'The project is designed to generate both qualitative and quantitative data on soil health and fertility using conventional as well as remote sensing and GIS techniques as explained below. Previous soil surveys in Sierra Leone have used conventional/traditional methods, which are extremely tedious, time-consuming, expensive, and limited by lack of accuracy and low repetitive value. In addition, the reports of such soil surveys were produced in formats that are not user-friendly. Considering the need for timely availability of user-friendly information on soil resources of any geographical area, it is of essence to assess and map soil resources and make this information available on time to the relevant stakeholders in the agriculture and related sectors for various policy planning and decision-making purposes. The uniqueness of this project is that it will use geospatial technology involving the use of remote sensing, GIS and GPS techniques to generate detailed spatial information on soil resources of the target areas. This approach is more cost effective, accurate and reliable, timely and faster than conventional ground-based surveys. Geospatial techniques are digital innovations that have rapidly evolved over the years and have proven to be very efficient and effective in assessing and mapping natural resources in many parts of the world. Through these technologies, several developing countries have been able to monitor and analyze their natural resources and produce timely and high-quality information with much accuracy. While these innovations have been rolled out in several West African countries, Sierra Leone has not fully grasped this advantage. This project will therefore generate detailed spatial data on soil acidity, Al toxicity, and soil fertility of Sierra Leone (which never existed before) in a short time and in a cost-effective manner. This spatial soil information will contribute signiï¬cantly to soil resource conservation and management. In addition, capacity building of farmers, students and subject matter specialists in MAFS to understand soil pH and Al toxicity variability across their lands, identify acid and Al toxic soils and assess the best ways to treat them, is a new innovation.', '4.2. Reconnaissance survey\r\nPrior to field work, desk survey and GIS work will commence in order to delineate arable areas that are fit for agriculture using georeferenced cadastral maps, toposheets, aerial photographs and satellite imageries as input maps using both visual and digital image interpretation techniques. This will be followed by a reconnaissance survey to identify major landforms, geology, drainage pattern, slope characteristics and land cover/land use, etc. Areas having similar landforms, geology, drainage pattern, slope characteristics and land cover/land use, etc. will be identified as soil mapping units. Using this information, a preliminary legend will be developed for detailed soil sampling. The collected samples will be analysed and results interpreted for informed decision making.\r\n4.3. Soil sampling \r\nSoil sampling will be conducted from January to April of every year before the commencement of the rains. Prior to this, a base map with a grid sampling frame of 500m x 500m will be prepared to guide soil sample collection. Soil samples will be collected at each grid intersection with the help of the Sirrus software navigation system installed in an IPad device. At each grid observation point, a representative composite soil sample will be collected within a radius of 50m to 100m from a depth of 0-20cm and 20-40cm together with relevant information on land use and management practices. The samples will be placed in zip-lock bags and labelled with their location features for laboratory analysis. The geographic location of each grid point (longitude and latitude of sampling locations) will be recorded using hand-held GPS devices. \r\n4.4. Experimental design and layout\r\n4.4.1. Greenhouse Pot Experiments \r\nThe pot experiments will be established in January 2024 at ETU-SL campus. About 5 kg of soil sample will be weighed from the bulk soil sampled from benchmark soil profile locations and famersâ€™ fields and put into each pot. A greenhouse of dimension 8m x 16m will be established and maintained in favourable and controlled microclimatic conditions. \r\nThe treatment will include grinded oyster shell at 6 levels (0, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000 kgha-1), basic slag at 6 levels (0, 50, 250, 500, 750, 1500 kgha-1), green manures of Gliricidia sepium at 6 levels (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 tha-1), palm kernel cake at 6 levels (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 tha-1), biochar at 6 levels (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30 tha-1), agricultural lime (CaCO3) at 6 levels (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5 Mgha-1) and 4 crops (rice, maize, groundnut, and cowpea). The pot locations in the greenhouse will be rotated twice per week to minimize the effect of variations in ambient light and temperature conditions. NPK fertilizers will be applied at recommended rates in splits.  The pots will be arranged in three rows following a Complete Randomized Design (CRD). The spacing between the rows and between pots in a row will be 0.5 m. For maize and cowpea, three seeds will be sown per pot and thinned to two after emergence in order to mimic field spacing such that 1 ha can hold 26,600 pots each with two plants. For rice and groundnut, two seeds will be sown per pot and thinned to one after emergence in order to mimic field spacing such that 1 ha can hold 26,600 pots each with one plant. The crops will be irrigated twice a week. Biomass harvesting and oven drying will take place at 4 weeks after planting (4WAP) and 8 weeks after planting (8WAP).\r\nPlant tissues will be sampled at 4WAP and 8WAP. One plant per pot will be randomly selected and harvested at 4WAP and 8WAP, respectively. The plant height will be measured from the soil level to the tip of the youngest leaf. At 8WAP, the roots will be retrieved from the pot by splitting the pot open and the soil will be carefully separated from the fibrous roots. The bare roots will then be placed on a table and their lengths measured. The mean length of roots will be measured from the main stocks up to the tips and recorded. Finally, all the shoot and root materials from each pot will be separately chopped into small pieces, placed in sampling brown paper bags and oven dried at 50 Â°C for 48 hours. Their dry weight will be recorded in grams per pot and converted to kg/ha by multiplying by total number of plants per ha (i.e., 53200 for maize and cowpea, and 26,600 for rice and cowpea).\r\n4.4.2. Field Experiments \r\n4.4.2.1. Design and set up \r\nThe field experiment will be designed and managed by the project technical staff and one MSc student but assisted by the farmers. After soil analysis of the first set of soil samples collected in the first year would have been completed, the major soil bodies will be identified based on soil-test results, and these will form the mapping units. Within each mapping unit, farmers growing rice, maize, groundnut and cowpea will be selected and their farms mapped for experimentation. The experiment will be conducted during the Mayâ€“July (as first season planting) and September-November (as second season planting) of 2024. The experiment will be repeated during the same seasons in 2025. The objective is to verify the outstanding good results from the greenhouse studies under the real-world farmerâ€™s conditions in the field and to have a pooled data of two years to validate statistical significance testing. To control variability between greenhouse and field data, similar inputs as those of the greenhouse experiment will be used. In addition, experimental set up, treatment application and planting will be done by both project technical staff and the farmer. The farmer will carry out all other agronomic practices like weeding and thinning in consultation with the project technical staff. However, all data collection will be exclusively done by the MSc student. Three out of the 18 best performing treatment combinations will be evaluated on farmerâ€™s field in a complete randomized block design (CRBD) with three replications per treatment for precision. The dimension of the plots shall be 4.5 x 4.0 m with a 1.5 m footpath between the plots. A control plot will be included as well.\r\n4.4.2.2. Land preparation, planting and inputs application \r\nThe land will be prepared by hand hoeing to satisfactory tilth in May 2024 and 2025 at onset of raining season. The soil amendments at targeted levels will be added to the topsoil as starters and these will be thoroughly mixed. Planting holes at a spacing of 0.75 m and 0.5 m for inter and intra-row, respectively, will be dug and the mixture will be added to the holes. The crops will be planted and all agronomic practices will be applied. \r\n4.4.2.3. Sampling and data collection \r\nInitial soil sampling and analyses will be done at the beginning of each year in January-April. The final soil sampling and analyses will be conducted in October-December of each year at the end of field experiment. Here, each field shall be gridded on 50m x 50m scale to give a sample size of 4 sample per hectare. Soil samples will be collected at each grid point and the geographic location of each grid point (longitude and latitude of sampling locations) will be recorded using hand-held GPS devices. Data on dry matter weight (DMW) will be collected also. In each field, twenty-four plant stands will be selected for sample collection leaving out one row on each side of the plot and the first two hills from either side of the rows to minimize border effect. From the 24 stands, a sub-sample of eight stands will be selected at random for the determination of growth parameters. The data from the eight stands will be averaged per plant to calculate the biomass weight. The DMW of biomass will be further converted to kgha-1 using the formula below. \r\nDMWha-1 (Kg) = (H ha-1 x2/1 x N)/(8 x 1000)                           equation (1)\r\nWhere;\r\nDMWha-1(Kg) = Oven dry weight of biomass ha-1 \r\nH ha-1 = No. of planting holes ha-1 at a spacing of 0.75 m by 0.5 m (=26600) \r\n2/1 = Number of plants per hole (i.e., 2 for maize and cowpea; 1 for rice and groundnut). \r\nN = Weight in g of DM from 8 randomly selected plants per plot. \r\n8 = No. of plants randomly selected per plot. \r\n1000 = A factor incorporated to convert g plot-1 of DM into kg ha-1\r\n4.5. Laboratory analysis \r\nThe soil and various soil acidity amendments (i.e., grinded oyster shell, basic slag, green manures of Gliricidia sepium, palm kernel cake, biochar, and agricultural lime) will be analyzed for their pH and nutrient status. The soil samples will be air-dried until a constant weight is obtained, after which they will be grinded and passed through 2 mm sieve and stored in plastic bags (dimension: 5 Ã— 7 cm). These samples will be analyzed following standard analytical procedures. The pH of the soils will be measured in water, 1M KCl, 0.01M CaCl2, 1M NaF (Black, 1965; Page et al., 1982). CEC will be estimated using neutral normal ammonium acetate (Black, 1965). Exchangeable Ca and Mg will be estimated from the ammonium acetate extract for CEC determination by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Model GBC, Avanda). Sodium and K will be estimated from the same extract by Flame Photometer. Percentage base saturation will be calculated using the equation outlined in Jackson (1958). Mechanical analysis of the soil samples will be done by international pipette method (Jackson, 1958). Organic carbon will be estimated by Wakley and Black method (Jackson, 1958). Total potential acidity will be estimated by Peech method (Peech et al., 1962), exchangeable acidity by Mc Lean method (Mc Lean, 1965), and the difference between total potential acidity and exchangeable acidity will be taken as the pH dependent acidity. Exchangeable and extracted Al will be determined by Mc Lean method (Mc Lean 1965), and the difference between extractable Al and exchangeable Al forms will be taken as the non- exchangeable Al. For estimating soluble Al, the soil will be extracted with 0.01M CaCl2 (soil solvent ratio 1:2.5) by shaking for 5 minutes and the Al in the extract will be estimated calorimetrically by aluminon method. Total Al will be determined by HCl-HF method as per Hossner (1996) and estimated by aluminon method. The oxalate Fe and Al (Feo and Alo) will be determined by extraction with ammonium oxalate in the dark (Mc Keague and Day, 1966) and the dithionite citrate bicarbonate extractable Fe and Al (Fed and Ald) will be determined by the method of Mehra and Jackson (1960). Total Mn and Fe will be estimated by HCl extraction (Jackson, 1958). DTPA -extractable Mn and Fe will be determined by Lindsay and Norvell (1978). Exchangeable Mn and Fe will be extracted with neutral normal ammonium acetate in soil solvent ratio of 1:10 and the concentration of Mn in the extract will be estimated by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Effective CEC will be determined by summation of exchangeable Na, K, Ca, Mg and Al in the 1M KCl extract (Reeuwijk, 1993), and Aluminium saturation percent will be expressed as per cent of the ECEC \r\n4.6. Assessing soil acidity status and acidification risk \r\n4.6.1. Assessing soil acidification risk\r\nRisk to soil acidification depends on 3 different issues: 1) the initial pH, 2) the soilâ€™s pH buffering capacity (pHBC), and 3) net inputs of acid or alkali. This research aims to assess potential soil acidification risk by estimating the initial pH and the vulnerability of the soil to pH change, which is reflected in its pHBC. \r\nTo assess the impact of soil pH on soil acidification risk, the study will be based on the nature and efficiency of the most active buffer reaction in each pH range as given Ngendo (2013). To assess the impact of soil pH buffering capacity on soil acidification risk, the equation of Helyar et al. (1990) developed for soils in the tropics will be used. The potential acidification risk will be categorized based on pH buffering capacity ranges recommended by Singh et al. (2003).\r\nSoil acidification rate reflects the decrease in soil pH or change in H+ activity in the soil. This will be calculated from the pHBC values. The number of years to reduce the pH by one unit will be estimated as recommended by Singh et al. (2003) and Helyar et al. (1990). In addition, the risk for Al toxicity will be estimated using the pH value. In fact, soils with pH value lower than 5.5 are deemed to have high risk of Al toxicity. To this, values of Al saturation would be used with a threshold of 15%.\r\n4.6.2. Mapping soil acidity and acidification risk\r\nAcidification risk mapping is a management tool for providing optimized strategies with respect to acidification risk. To map soil acidity status and identify potential acidification risk areas using the generated dataset, several GIS data modelling techniques will be applied and the best performing models will be used in final map production. \r\nMaps and their related attributes datasets will be geo-matched. After analyzing the soil samples, the results will be compiled in excel file. Quality checks will be conducted and the verified data will be saved in DBF file format for use in ArcGIS. The data will be opened in ArcGIS interface and subjected to spatial modelling tools such as interpolation toolbox using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique. This interpolation method explicitly implements the assumption that sample locations that are close to one another are more alike than those that are farther apart. In this way, thematic maps of soil health and fertility will be generated.\r\nMaps showing the spatial distribution of soil health and fertility indicators and their calculated average values will be produced by matching the measured soil properties with their critical values. These classes will indicate the deficiencies, sufficiency and toxicities of nutrients as well as other soil physical and chemical parameters that limit nutrient availability in soils. \r\nIn order to combine both numerical and categorical variables in the assessment of soil acidification indicators, a classification tree-based approach will be adopted as well. This method allows the assessment of the impact of each soil acidity indicator in a decreasing order and also enhance the interpretation of results. To check the quality of the tree, the risk estimate and standard error will be used as a measure of the treeâ€™s predictive accuracy. \r\nThe mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) will be used to check the quality of the maps. \r\n4.6.3. Estimation and mapping of liming requirements (LR)\r\nAfter identifying acidification risk areas and hotspots, strategies for optimizing soil protection and management will be recommended. Before the estimation of lime requirement, the soils will be categorized into two classes; 1) soils that require liming (pH < 5.5) and 2) soil that do not require liming (pH < 5.5). To calculate lime requirement for these risk areas, several equations will be modelled including Yost method (Yost et al., 1988), Peech method (Peech, 1965), Adams and Evans method (Adams and Evans, 1962), and exchangeable Al method (Kamprath, 1970). \r\n4.7. Effect of liming\r\n4.7.1. Effect of liming on nutrient availability \r\nThis will be an incubation experiment, where the lime requirement (LR) of the soils will be estimated by Peech method (Peech, 1965). The treatments will comprise of four levels of lime, at the rates of 25, 50, 75 and 100 per cent of the lime requirement and a no lime control. Agricultural lime (CaCO3) will be used as the source of lime. In each treatment the required dose of lime will be thoroughly mixed with 1 kg soil and incubated in the laboratory at ambient temperature of 24 - 28Â° C for a period of 90 days. Moisture level will be maintained at field capacity throughout the period of incubation. The design of the experiment will be a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with six replications. \r\nThe initial soil properties will be determined by standard procedure outlined in Jackson (1958). The incubated soil samples will be collected at 15 days intervals up to 90 days and analyzed for organic carbon, available P, K, Ca and Mg (Jackson, 1958). Available P will be extracted using Bray â€“ II extractant (0.03 N ammonium fluoride in 0.1N HCl) (Bray and Kurtz, 1945) and estimated calorimetrically by molybdenum blue method at 660 nm wavelength. Available K will be extracted by Morganâ€™s reagent (sodium acetate + acetic acid buffer of pH 4.8) (Morgan, 1941) and estimated by flame photometer. Calcium and Mg from the Morgan extract will be estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The soil pH (1:2.5, soil: water ratio) will be measured by glass electrode method. Exchangeable Al will be extracted with 1M KCl and estimated by aluminon method (Hsu, 1963; Jayman and Sivasubramanian, 1974) and available Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn will be estimated by DTPA extractant (Lindsay and Norvell, 1978) after 90 days of incubation. \r\nThe individual parameters will be statistically analyzed in CRD and the changes over a period of time will be estimated by factorial analysis (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967). \r\n4.7.2. Effect of liming on availability of nutrients and crop growth \r\nField experiment will be conducted during the Mayâ€“July (as first season planting) and September-November (as second season planting) in 2024 and 2025. Lime requirement estimated by Peech method (Peech, 1965) will be used as a baseline data. There will be five treatments including an absolute control (no lime, no fertilizer), fertilizer and three levels of agricultural lime (CaCO3) viz., 1/3, 2/3 and full LR alone and in combination with fertilizer. The design of the experiment will be a randomized block design with three replications. \r\nBeds with dimensions of 4.5m x 1.5m will be prepared following appropriate agronomic practices and agricultural lime (CaCO3) will be incorporated with a fork as per the treatments. Two weeks after liming, rice, maize, groundnut and cowpea seeds will be planted using standard spacing. Fertilizers application will be done as per recommended rates. All cultural operations will be strictly followed and biophysical data will be collected at 4WAP and at harvest. \r\nSoil samples from 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm will be collected at two weekly intervals during the growth of the crop and these will be analyzed for physicochemical properties using standard analytical methods. Leaf samples will be collected and analyzed for total nutrient concentration (Piper, 1942). The data will be analyzed statistically. \r\n4.7.3. Comparative evaluation of liming materials on nutrient availability and crop growth \r\nField experiment will be conducted during the Mayâ€“July (as first season planting) and September-November (as second season planting) in 2024 and 2025. Lime requirement estimated by Peech method (Peech, 1965) will be used as a baseline data. There will be five treatments including an absolute control (no lime, no fertilizer), fertilizer alone and three sources of lime viz; agricultural lime (quick lime), dolomite and phosphogypsum @ of 100 per cent lime requirement with and without fertilizer. The experiment will be laid out in a randomized block design with four replications. \r\nBeds with dimensions of 4.5m x 1.5m will be prepared following appropriate agronomic practices and agricultural lime (CaCO3) will be incorporated with a fork as per the treatments. Two weeks after liming rice, maize, groundnut and cowpea seeds will be planted using standard spacing. Fertilizers application will be done as per recommended rates. All cultural operations will be strictly followed and biophysical data will be collected at 4th week after planting and at harvest. \r\nSoil samples will be collected from 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm at the time of planting, before fertilizer application and at time of harvest. These soil samples will be analyzed for physicochemical properties using standard analytical methods. The data will be analyzed statistically (Snedecor and. Cochran1967). \r\nTo study the residual effect of liming materials, the experiment was repeated in the same beds in 2025 planting seasons also. As in previous seasons, the plant biophysical data will be collected at 4th week after planting and at harvest and soil samples from 0-20 cm will be collected at the time of planting, before fertilizer application and at time of harvest and analyzed for pH and availability of nutrients. The data will be analyzed statistically (Snedecor and. Cochran1967).\r\n4.8. Statistical analysis\r\nThe biophysical data obtained in this study (i.e., biomass yield, plant height, root length, microbial density, soil pH, etc.) will be compiled in excel. These will be tested for normality and then subjected to ANOVA to separate the treatment means found to be significantly different from each other using least significant difference (LSD) at p < 0.05 (Buysse et al., 2004)\r\nDescriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) of acidity indicators will be calculated using SPSS statistical package. Correlations among these acidity indicators and between these indicators and other environmental variables, will also be evaluated using the guidelines for classification of correlation strength as Class 1: 0 - 0.2 (very weak), Class 2): 0.2-0.4 (weak), Class 3: 0.4-0.7 (moderate), Class 4: 0.7-0.9 (strong) and Class 5: 0.9-1 (very strong). The potential interaction effect of categorical variables on soil acidity will be analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The significantly different soil pH means depending on each environmental variable will be assessed as well using Tamhane\'s post-hoc test. Soil pH means of various agroecologies will be compared at probability p< 0.05 using Fischerâ€™s least significant difference (L.S.D).', 'No', '', '', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1),

(6, 11, 45, 'Procedure 1. Germplasm collection for rootstock development: \r\nSystematic Citrus (sweet and bitter oranges) germplasm collection nation-wide will be carried out. Viable seed per fruit is estimated to be 15 filled seeds. The total seeds needed for each species will be 23,000 (bitter orange) and 23,000 (sweet orange) seeds. One hundred and twenty (120) fruits will be purchased per district on bitter and sweet oranges making a total of 240 fruit per district. The overall total fruit to be collect on each species will be 1,667 (bitter orange) and 1,667 (sweet orange) fruits. Fruits to be selected and collected on both species must base on the following characters; reduction in parental heigh, canopy formation, fruit size, colour, taste, bearing and pests and disease history, plus any other observations on the parental tree.  All the collected citrus fruits will be label based on their origin and district and will be taken to ETUSL Bunumbu for processing of seeds. Similarly, after the development of the root stock, the second phase of the collection will be on the scion (budwood) on desirable parent tree of selected sweet orange trees in every district with the exception of Western and Rural districts. A budwood with three functional buds of one foot in length will be harvested and a total of 7,667 budwoods will be harvested for budding at ETUSL Bunumbu.\r\nProcedure 2. Nursery establishment for rootstock: A standard modern nursery will be constructed with dimension of 20 m x 15 m to accommodate 23,000 seeds of bitter orange and 23,000 seeds of sweet orange. After the construction of the nursery, 46,000 polybags will be filled and lined in the nursery at 4 fts wide to any length with 2 fts pathway for easy accessibility to nursery practices. Seeds will be extracted from the collected citrus fruit martials and filled up seeds will be chosen. The selected seeds will be wash with clean water and dried in a shade. Sundry of seeds will be done to reduce the moisture content in seeds for few days. To break seed latency, the hard coat must be gently removed not to damage the embryo and the prepared seeds will now be nurse polybags. Irrigation of the nursery will be carried out especially in the dry season and agro-chemicals such as fertilizers, pests and diseases control chemicals will be used where necessary.\r\nProcedure 3. Training of farmers on citrus best management practices: Three days training on citrus and its management will be undertaken to equip farmers with the knowledge before the grafting/budding exercise and seedling distribution to selected trained farmers. Meanwhile, 10 farmers per district making a total of 140 farmers will be trained in Citrus production practices.\r\nProcedure 4. Grafting in citrus tree (T-budding): Bitter orange will be use as rootstock, while sweet orange scion from selected desirable parent tree. Budwood will be collected after the establishment of the rootstock in the growing season. Hardened twigs with buds whose bark have started to harden will be collected as scion. A foot long scion will be harvested and store them in a bag in a fridge for up to three months if necessary. Raised rootstocks of bitter orange (Trifoliate Orange) of best quality robust and disease resistant will be selected. The Trifoliate Orange will now be prepared for grafting/budding. Six inches up from the ground, a one-inch vertical slice will be made use a with a sharp budding knife to cut through the rootstockâ€™s bark and another horizontal cut at the bottom of the cut to form an upside-down T will be made. Ater that, bud will be prepared from the harvested scion using the same budding knife. One-inch slice of wood (same length as the T-cut on the rootstock) cut out will be made on the bud from the budwood and insure both wood and bark in the cut with a smooth edge made to enable fast joint together and heal best. The citrus bud will now be inserted up under the flaps made in the rootstockâ€™s bark and it must be inserted fully. The goal here is to create a joining between the green cambium layers so nutrients can flow from the roots to the new bud. The top and bottom of the new graft with budding tape will be wrap to hold everything in place and protects the graft/bud as it heals. Care must be taken not to cover the bud itself. After two to four weeks, the budding tape should be removed so it doesnâ€™t choke the tree. Once the new bud has started pushing out a few inches of new growth, continue to train the tree to grow upwards. It should be growing much faster than it would from seed.\r\nProcedure 5. Distribution of grafted/budded seedlings: A targeted farmers of 10 per district with a grand total of 140 trained farmers in citrus cultivation will be given 150 raised seedlings for the establishment of one-acre sweet orange farm per farmer. A total of 140 acres or 56 hectares will be established across the country.

(10, 15, 33, 'Design thinking methodology which is firmly supported by engineering design process would be utilized in designing the WATA-STOVE. The choice of this approach is because, the WATA-STOVE design is aimed at empathizing with end-users of clean cooking technologies to understand their needs and incorporate those needs in to the design from the conceptual design phase. While utilizing the design thinking approach, engineering design processes would be used to ensure that the WATA-STOVE design meets all safety standard and regulations. Furthermore, scientific research and literature reviews would provide a solid theoretical foundation for the engineering design processes stated above. ', 'One-third of the global population (2.4 billion people) lack access to clean cooking solution1. The use of inefficient fuel is a health risk and major cause of death and diseases especially for women and children1. In Africa alone, women account for 60% of the total death owing to smoke inhalation and indoor air pollution2.  With the current trends, 1.1 billion Africans may lack access to clean cooking technologies by 2050 resulting to a projected 3.2 million deaths annually and that includes the death of 273,000 children3. This is a scary factual projection which may come to reality if the necessary technological actions are not taken to innovate and scale affordable clean cooking solution across Africa; especially in the rural communities. \r\nSierra Leone, which is designated by the United Nations as one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the world is already facing grave consequences owing to the lack scaled access to affordable clean cooking technologies.  As of 2023, 27% of households in Sierra Leone cook with commercialized polluting cooking fuels (charcoal), while 99% of households use either firewood or charcoal4 . Even the 25% Sierra Leoneans who are connected to grid electricity are still cooking with polluting fuels4. Even though there are many clean cooking technologies in the global market today, scaling up access to those technologies in the context of Sierra Leone has been challenging. Owing to the disruption of global supply chain of petroleum products, the price of fuel (Including LPGs) in Sierra Leone has increased by a staggering 43% in the last 12 months alone5. Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), stoves commonly known in Sierra Leone as Afri-Gas and/or NP-Gas cooking stove is only used by less than 1% Sierra Leoneans for cooking4. This is because the upfront and operational cost of LPG cooking stove is expensive.   Even though there are other locally manufactured cooking stoves in Sierra Leone, almost all of them still depend on burning charcoal to generate the heat needed for cooking. This eventually still facilitates deforestation and the release of CO2 to the atmosphere. In fact, even the cost of a bag of charcoal in Sierra Leone has increased by not less than 30% in the post COVID-19 era. \r\nThere are many scientifically proven ways to generate combustible gases which could be used in clean cooking solution. Hydrogen-Oxygen gas generation by electrolysis is one of those oldest technologies dating back to the 19th Century6. HHO gas, also known as oxyhydrogen gas, is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the electrolysis of water7. The process involves passing electric current through water containing catalyst (electrolyte), to split the water molecules into Hydrogen and Oxygen6. The amount of the Hydrogen and Oxygen liberated at the electrodes depend on the concentration of the electrolyte and the amount to electric current applied to the electrolyte7.  Other factors which have been scientifically proven to influence the process of electrolysis include, the nature of the material of the electrode used, the distance between the electrodes, the voltage applied between the electrodes and the surface area of the electrode exposed to the electrolyte. The best set up by Rusdianasari R. et al, was achieved by using an electrolyte concentration of sodium hydroxyl at 0.05 M and applying an electric current of 15 A to produce 0.1028 LPM HHO gas with an electric current efficiency of 89.13%7. \r\nThe Hydrogen and Oxygen produced at the electrodes in the ratio 2:1, are mixed to produce the HHO which is highly flammable and could be effective for cooking applications. Unlike LPGs which burn and release CO2 in the atmosphere, HHO burns efficiently with zero carbon emission and no air pollutant. This feature of the HHO makes it promising for clean cooking application and accelerates efforts to meet net zero carbon emission targets. \r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.

This will also touch on green city, aesthetics, recreation, biodiversity, ecosystem services, life and property, etc. Bo City will be used as a case study, representing the broader urban areas in Sierra Leone. Bo is the second largest city in Sierra Leone, second only to the capital city of Freetown and with a population of 223,075 (Stat-SL, 2021). Bo is the administrative city of the Southern Province in Sierra Leone, where Njala University (the host institution of the researchers) operates two campuses. The city has plenty of wetlands (swamps and marshlands) that receive runoff generated by torrential rains under the ongoing climate change. The generated runoff is increasing with worsening climate change, posing a significant risk of flooding and flood damage to agriculture, and life and property in the city.\r\nTo do this, a high-resolution (1 m x 1 m) remote-sensing (both land-use and DEM) data will be sought for Bo City and the environs. These data sets will be used to delineate very precisely what part of the city that is used for what purpose and the area most likely prone to the 100-year flooding event. The 100-year flooding event will be simulated using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Derived Models, with precipitation and water-level data (Wu, 20023). Next, the flood-prone areas will be delineated and buffer zones set up in the flood belts around the wetlands and along the waterways. Finally, engineered climate-smart and climate-resilient strategies will be used to establish economic trees, ponds, lakes and drainage cages to capture solid waste in runoff and prevent it from deposition into the wetlands or waterways. The captured solid waste can then be collected for either landfilling or for recycling depending on which is option is optimal. River training will also be done along the waterways to make free the flow of water and prevent flooding that could affect agricultural activities in the wetlands.\r\nBefore the development intervention, however, baseline (pre-development) data will be collected. This data will be analyzed against post-development data to measure the impact of the development intervention on urban agriculture, biodiversity, aesthetic, greenery, life/property and on the socio-economic growth of the city.\r\n1.1.	Conceptual / Theoretical Framework\r\nThe conceptual/theoretical framework is based on the premise that engineered climate-smart techniques can be used to build buffer zones around wetlands and along waterways in urban areas to control damage to urban agriculture but also to life and property. The buffer zones will be planted with a mix of useful trees and low bush and then lawns maintained under the trees. Where applicable, runoff retention ponds or artificial lakes will be built as collection, settlement and cleaning points of runoff waters from across the city. Where also applicable, fortified sloid waste cages will be built to capture solid wastes at the mouth of drainages that discharge into wetlands and waterways.\r\nThe waste cage is the filter that prevents all solid wastes from being discharged into the wetlands and waterways. The wastes (e.g., plastic, tins and other solid wastes) will then be collected for recycling or for engineered landfilling. The roads, ponds, lakes, lawns, bushes and trees of the buffer zone can provide paid recreation and other ecological services in the city. It will also serve the concept of green city, with the aesthetic and beauty required of modern cities today. The buffers can also help clear urban air by capturing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it as biomass and soil carbon in the buffer zones and the wetlands.\r\nTo make this possible, the team of researchers will engage key stakeholders (especially those who own land/property in delineated buffer zones) through the city council authorities on the project and work out mutually agreeable ways of smoothly implementing the project. This will reinforce the GoSL land policy of not construct (like putting up dwelling houses) in wetlands.\r\n1.2.	User Participation\r\nThis type of project usually belongs to the government, specifically the local/city council. It is a city development project that makes provision for the recreation and relaxation of city inhabitants. It is also as an income-generating project and as it is a job-creating one. Thus, the implementation could call for buyouts of all such lands if it is entirely a government venture. It can as also be one of public-private venture, in which case a limited or no land buyout could be required. Where it is a completely private venture (and especially so involving the land owners), no land will be bought out. By the GoSL land policy, marshlands/wetlands are not dwelling lands. This, however, is hardly enforced today in Sierra Leone. This project will build consciousness about this policy and fully factor it into urban/city planning and development.\r\nIrrespectively, the strategy will require significant financial investment and it will therefore be piloted for a small area in the project city. A limited trial case will allow the space needed to determine the economic impacts of the climate-smart/climate-resilient intervention on urban agriculture, but also on the related social, cultural and ecological services.\r\n1.3.	Data Collection\r\nAs already noted, there will be two phases of data collection â€” the pre-intervention (baseline) data collection phase and then the post-intervention data collection phase. In each phase, both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected.\r\nThe qualitative data will principally be collected through questionnaires, personal interviews, focus group discussions, past experiences and personal observations. Professional digital photographs of the pre-intervention phase will be taken and documented too.\r\nFor the quantitative data, a portion will be remotely collected and another portion collected directly in the field. Land-use data, topographic (DEM) data, investment and development data, climate data, and impact data will be variously collected. The details of each dataset (collection frequency, coverage, resolution, etc.) will be determined at the implementation phase of the project, but guided by the degree of information needed at each phase. \r\n1.4.	Data Analysis\r\nThe GIS platform will be used for spatial data (e.g., land-use and DEM data) analysis. The SPSS will also be used for temporal, social and economic data analysis â€” impact analysis. The MS Excel will as well be handy in preliminary data processing, including data inputting, outlier removal and correcting other irregularities. The flood model will be used to simulate the 100-year cycle flooding in the case-study area. These software platforms are powerful enough for also plotting and visually displaying the results of the analyzed data.', 'Not related to any on-going research as it is a new proposal for support.', 'No', '', '', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1),

For fertility or fecundity of the female a pair of male and female of the emerged adults are allowed to mate 24hr and then confined on selected host plants. For this activity a cohort of 10 mated female adults will be confined to a host plants and number eggs lad daily are observed  until the last female died. \r\n    The functional and numerical responses are the two most important parameters that determine the efficacy of biological control agent and these can be measured by undertaken the following activity: For functional response ,  the natural enemy under investigation will be exposed to five varying prey densities (10, 20,30, 40 and 50 ) for  daily consumptions. For numerical response i.e. the ability of the natural enemy to increase in number, the number of eggs laid daily are monitored for each prey density.  \r\n    The agro-ecologies most preferably orchards and cash crop plantations will be scouted  for fungal infected cadavers i.e. dead bodies of insects that have been killed as a result of fungal infection. These cadavers which are major fungal sources will be  isolated through tissue culture technique following the single spore isolation protocols according to Hu et al (2012). The spores isolated will be cultured severally to purify the strains and then identified and labelled serially  with help of a mycologist.  The identified fungal strains or isolates are characterized and then tested for virulence against selected target pests under laboratory conditions.     \r\nThe protocol of isolation of fungal strain according to Hu et al (2012)  is advantageous  in the sense that pure strains will be produced without any form of contamination from other pathogen sources .  \r\n', 'This project is not related to any ongoing research ', 'No', '', '', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 1),

Chemical energy is released when biofuel goes through combustion process. This process involves oxidation with the combustible components like flue gases which produces heat energy (Van loo and Koppejan, 2008).   A better understanding of the combustion of any material is grasped in the fire triangle. Mixing of these three components, heat, fuel and air, are required for fire to be started. The fire may be extinguished by suffocation (preventing air from flowing), or quenched with water (reducing temperature), or removing the fuel. Smouldering combustion conditions are due to lack of oxygen/air. The fire triangle represents the three main components of combustion. The three legs of the triangle represent the three inputs to the chemical equation for combustion, heat, fuel and air (oxygen). Complete combustion is important and it is contingent on sufficient air supply (van loo and Koppejan, 2008). \r\n\r\n Cookstoves can be supplied with primary air through two main methods: natural and forced drafts. Natural draft can affect air flow rates and combustion condition, in the sense that the flow conditions in the stove can be controlled through design parameters, but too low and too high flow rates occur in practice. Low draught can lead to inadequate air thereby causing fire to be extinguished. *On the contrary, too high a draught leads to excess air which increases combustion temperature and gasification rate. Forced draughts are used in continuous combustion operations wherein air blowers or fans are used to provide constant or regulated supply of primary air as and when required. This draught method can significantly increase gasification and combustion temperatures (Tissari. 2008)\r\n\r\nConversion of biomass (wood) to heat energy\r\n Conversion of biomass, wood, depends on heat and oxygen, as they control the type of thermal conversion processes (Reed and Golden, 1988). As more oxygen and heat are added to the process, different types of thermal conversion is obtained. Pyrolysis is at the lowest conversion stage, requiring little or no amount of oxygen, and about 4000c of heat (Lehmann, 2007). Gasification is thermochemical process that requires some oxygen and higher temperature, above 4000c to convert solids or liquids to a value added gas product (syngas) (Hua and Gholizadeh, 2019). Gasification plants produce lower amount of major air pollutants, like SO2, Nitrous Oxides and particulates, than direct combustion (Basu 2013). Lastly, combustion requires the highest oxygen and temperature, above 6000c, as more oxygen and heat is added, it will cause the biomass to move from pyrolysis into gasification and then finally into combustion, the highest heat transfer (Basu, 2013). The combustion processes outlined are also present in cookstoves and, such design principles are used in the design of the stove for this proposed study. Given that cookstoves requires heat, then combustion is stage is an essential to focus on as regards design and technical geometry.\r\n\r\nHeat transfer processes in a cookstove \r\nBurning solid biomass in biomass cookstoves converts chemical energy into thermal energy which provides useful heat for cooking and heating (Bushnell, 1987). portrays heat transfer contribution,  the total heat gain (32.1%) are those from convection and radiation, 17.5% and 14.6% respectively, whereas total heat loss is 67.8%. this value of heat loss is more than twice the heat gain. furthermore, about a third (29%) of the energy produced is wasted. radiation heat losses account for 19% of heat loss, (Zube, 2010).  Accordingly, reduction of these losses is one of the objectives of this proposed study.\r\n\r\nTraditional cooking \r\nThe traditional cooking methods comes indifferent variations, for example, the built-in mud stove and three stone fire (TSF) stove. The latter is most commonly used in rural communities of developing countries, especially Africa. The TSF stove is made up of three stones that are placed on the ground in the shape of a triangle within which fuel, mostly wood, is placed horizontally. The wood are ignited and then a pot or pan is placed atop the stones. \r\nAs part of its advantages, it takes less time to setup, cheap and easy to use with little tending time. \r\nHowever, it comes with disadvantages, primary air is reduce due to surface area of wood exposed and heat is lost through conduction. Increased radiation losses resulting from the charcoal and fire to the surrounding. Bryden (2010) points out that incomplete combustion occurs when the amount of primary air available to react with the fuel is reduced, resulting in an increase in indoor air pollution (IAP). In effect, tsf is notorious for consuming so much fuel, thereby contributing to its low thermal inefficiency, 14% (Ballard-tremeer, 1996). An investigation into how both emissions and fuel consumption can be reduced with an increase in thermal efficiency, is the aim of this proposed study. It is worth noting that, better fuel efficiency that leads to emission reductions are factors needed to reduce health risks associated with cookstoves. \r\n\r\nMoving from traditional to improved biomass cookstoves\r\nthere are several different types of improved cookstoves available, for example, rocket elbow or l stove and top lift up draft (TLUD), as shown in figures 2.5a, and 2.5b respectively (Anderson, 2007). The rocket elbow stove works on continuous feeding of fuel, leading to more tending time while the tlud stove is considered a gasifier and, smoke is prevented during cooking when no fuel is added (Bryden, 2010). Compared to the traditional three stone fire stove, improved cookstoves are portable and can be used both indoors and outdoors (Zube, 2010). Experimental results suggest that new wood burning cookstoves should be carefully designed, constructed and operated with the aim of achieving better thermal efficiency (Geller, 1982). Researchers such as Geller (1982), Anderson (2007) and Verhaart (1982) focused on improvement on the structure of the combustion chamber and distance between the end of the stove and bottom of pot, as these factors are essential for better heat transfer. The proposed design of the stove for this study makes use of both rocket and tlud principles of burning solid biomass fuel to generate heat.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that efficiency of improved cookstoves does not always lead to reduced emissions. Some researchers have shown a positive correlation between efficiency and emission (Bhattacharya and Salam, 2002). However, when compared with traditional biomass cookstoves, improved biomass cookstoves are found to be more efficient, for they consume less fuel, 20 â€“ 50% (Mukunda et al., 1988). Recent studies have shown that improved cookstoves are more efficient than traditional three stone fire stoves (Parajuli et al., 2019; Gumino et al., 2020; Mekonnen, 2020; Sutar, 2022). Medina et al. (2017) evaluate the energy and emissions performance of ï¬ve improved cookstoves in homes in rural Mexico. Results show an improvement in combustion eï¬ƒciency and a 44% average reduction in co total emissions, compared with the traditional tsf stove. Rocket elbow stoves tests results, when compared to tsf, show a reduction in fuel saving of 41% with a reduction in co and pm25 by 46% and 56% respectively (Approvecho Research Center, 2014). IAP caused by traditional three fire stove whereas improved cookstoves are better alternatives to address pollution and poor efficiency (Jung and Huxham, 2019; Ahmad et al., 2022),\r\n\r\nAdoption of biomass cookstoves\r\nUsersâ€™ acceptance of the stoves is another important aspect of stove design parameters, as a stove can be well designed but if users perspectives are not factored into the design, its acceptance will be minimal. Acceptability is increased if stove is easy to operate, cheap, emits less smoke, durable, safe and easy to repair using local knowledge (Bryden, 2010; Anderson, 2007). Kersten et al. (2017) point out that adoption of improved cookstoves is contingent on cultural, social and functional factors. Further barriers include; low family income, little or no involvement of women in the design process;, lack or little education of women, inadequate knowledge of the effect of inefficient biomass cookstove on the environment and health (Saraswati., 2018). Effective communication is an important factor for better uptake of improved cookstove. The outcomes of both clean cooking stoves and traditional forms of cooking should be understood by policy makers and stove users for effective uptake of improved cookstoves. Furthermore, places of learning, worship, work and entertainment should be involved in the education process regarding these stoves (Clean Cooking Alliance 2023). Therefore, it is pertinent for researchers to consider these factors in order to design and produce cookstoves that are less polluting but with improved heat transfer and thermal efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe review has shown that the use of improved cookstoves can lead to less fuel usage leading to a reduction in environmental pollution as less trees are cut down. Nevertheless, there is need for further improvement in the form of: ease of use, cooking time, combination of fuel feed methods, thermal efficiency and environmental pollution. However, reviewed literatures hardly reveal studies that have combined both rocket and top-down up draft principles in cookstove design and production, especially in Sierra Leone. As a consequence, this study is expected to come up with a design that is capable of addressing these challenges.\r\n', 'No', '', '', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 4);

(23, 32, 88, 'Objective 1\r\nActivity 1.1. Introduce released drought-tolerant and Striga-resistant maize varieties and hybrids with varying maturity periods from the subregion and test for registration and release to farmers in Sierra Leone. \r\nSome hybrids and open-pollinated maize varieties of extra-early, early, intermediate and late maturity with tolerance to drought and resistance to S. hermonthica have been released in the subregion. As the production zones where the released varieties and hybrids share similar production conditions in Sierra Leone, testing seeds of these maize varieties in Sierra Leone will facilitate the selection of elite maize varieties for adaption by farmers. ETU-SL will then supply breeder seeds of parents of the released hybrids and open-pollinated maize varieties to government-supported agencies like the Seed Multiplication Programme (SMP) to support the production of foundation seeds. This approach may also accelerate access to sufficient quantities of certified seeds from seed companies such as Bantus Brother Foundation (BBF) to meet the seed demand for scaling out in the focal regions in Sierra Leone.\r\nActivity 1.2. Facilitate farmer adoption of appropriate climate smart agricultural practices, soil fertility management, and natural resource management (NRM) practices)\r\nExtension methods including demonstration plots and field days, are some of the major strategies for introducing the findings of modern research in agricultural practices to increase agricultural production and uplift of the rural masses in general. Field demonstrations and field days are effective means of communication to transmit knowledge and skills, and the interested may easily see, hear, and learn the things conveyed by extension workers. Demonstration plots are one of the best methods to improve technology uptake by smallholder farmers. In this project, we will work with farmers groups in the selected communities to select lead farmers to manage technology demonstration plots on their behalf. Selected best-bet technologies will be promoted in lead farmersâ€™ managed on-farm demonstration plots. Each lead farmer representing a community-based organization (CBO) in his community will have two plots each measuring 400 m2. The first plot will consist of the improved crop production and management technologies with the farmers taught to manage the crops using the supplied inputs. The second plot will serve as control where the farmer will be allowed to use his own crop varieties and crop management systems. A total of 75 demonstration sites, containing 150 plots (2 plots per site) will be established. To facilitate farmer to farmer transfer of knowledge, and create more awareness among farmers, lead farmers in selected communities will be encouraged to bring members from the CBOs they represent to demonstration fields to learn from what he/she is doing. Mid and end of season evaluations and field days will be organized periodically during the cropping season to popularize crop production and management technologies and create demand. In addition to field demonstrations and field days, the project will create awareness through radio and TV programs and through video clubs on the performance of crop production and management technologies in the target communities. \r\nThe project will also link farmer organizations to agro-dealers in the target region to enable them access to legal and effective chemicals for pest control. Pearl millet, sorghum and groundnut are all susceptible to insect pests (pearl millet head miner, sorghum midge) and diseases (groundnut rosette), which contribute to the low productivity. For pearl millet, we will mainly emphasize on the dissemination of the biological control approach (Ba et al., 2014) for controlling the pearl millet head miner, one of the most devastating insect pests. For sorghum and groundnut, we will mainly focus on dissemination of existing sorghum midge resistant varieties and groundnut rosette resistant varieties already available in the subregion. \r\nActivity 1.3. Testing and demonstration of Striga resistant, drought tolerant and downy mildew resistant pearl millet varieties in different agro-ecologies of Sierra Leone. \r\nSeveral varieties of pearl millet with resistance to Striga hermonthica and downy mildew including ICMV 147141, ICMV 147142, ICMV 147143, ICMV 147144 and ICMV 167012 have been developed and released by several research institutions in the subregion for further dissemination to farmers. These varieties have not only proven to be resistant to Striga hermonthica and downy mildew but also contain high concentration of micronutrients such as Fe (38-40 ppm) and Zn (35-37 ppm). These varieties will be demonstrated in large number of farmersâ€™ fields in selected communities. The best-bet varieties will be identified and recommended to farmers and seed companies.\r\nActivity 1.4. Produce and supply of breeder seeds of parents of released maize hybrids and varieties to national seed companies and other seed production entities to increase certified seed production for marketing in the country.\r\nETU-SL will multiply and market quality seeds of the released multiple stress tolerant maize varieties and hybrids. The project will embark on the production of breeder and foundation seeds of parents of stress resilient maize hybrids and varieties under in different agro-ecologies and supply them to seed production entities for certified seed production and marketing in the country. This activity will also focus on the training of technical staff of seed producing companies involved in monitoring the day-to-day field management and operations. The training will be practical to equip the support staff of the seed producers with skills in the production of good quality sees of parental lines of hybrids and in the maintenance of the genetic purity of parents during the multiplication of foundation and certified seeds.\r\nActivity 1.5. Train smallholder farmers and extension agents on appropriate climate smart crop production and management practices\r\nIt is not enough to introduce and demonstrate technologies without training the stakeholders on their proper use. We propose to strengthen stakeholders at three levels. Firstly, we will train extension service providers (public sector, NGOs and private sector) in the correct use of the technologies to enable them pass on the training to the smallholder farmers. In addition, we will provide training to the lead farmers in the use of the technologies. The lead farmers will also be trained in leadership skills. Each lead farmer will be assigned about 25 farmers in a group to train in the use of the introduced crop production and management technologies. \r\nActivity 1.6. Sensitize and train farmers on monitoring, surveillance and scouting for the identification, early warning and appropriate control measures for Fall Army Worm (FAW) \r\nFAW is a new emerging threat to cereal crop production in Africa. Due to its rapid spread and distinctive ability to inflict widespread damage across multiple crops, FAW poses a serious threat to the food and nutrition security and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of farming households in SSA â€“ particularly when layered upon other drivers of food insecurity such as aberrant weather conditions. FAW has the potential to cause yield losses in maize for example, of 8.3 to 20.6 M metric tons per year, in just 12 of Africaâ€™s maize producing countries in the absence of proper control methods (CABI, 2017). In the absence of maize, FAW is reported to attack over 80 other crops including pearl millet, sorghum, and groundnut. We will demonstrate the use of â€œearly warningâ€ and the â€œavailable and judicious use of environment friendly agrochemical products as a short-term control measureâ€ to manage FAW at the various experimental sites. We will also train farmers and extension service providers on monitoring, surveillance, scouting and identification for use as an early warning system, and train extension personnel and smallholder farmers on the safe handling and use of the available and legal environment- friendly agrochemical products. \r\nObjective 2\r\nActivity 2.1. Collect historical and current weather data from strategic locations in target communities to use in model calibration, validation and application. \r\nOne of the most important inputs in modeling crop growth in different environment is the acquisition of quality historical data from the location or sites in the target zones of the project. The project will work with the Sierra Leone Meteorological Agency (SLeMet) and other research institutions to acquire weather data for use in short and long-term simulation of crop performance. \r\nActivity 2.2. Train farmers in interpreting weather forecasts and using these in deciding on their agronomic skills such as optimal planting and weeding times. \r\nIf farmers have access to appropriate weather forecasts, they can better plan their farm activities. In this project, the farmers will be trained on the use of seasonal and short-term weather forecasts. In addition, agronomic tests will be conducted to assess farmersâ€™ benefits of using weather forecast under traditional and improved crop management. The project will use mobile telephones to provide weather forecast to the farmers.\r\nActivity 2.3. Collect soil profile data from target communities for input into the models. \r\nIn addition to weather data, information on soil physical and chemical properties enables researchers to simulate the performance of any crop variety in a given location. In this project, we intend to use spatial modelling GIS tools to select strategic sites in the target communities where we will dig profiles and characterize the soils for both physical and chemical properties. From the onset of the project, the technical team will endeavour to fully understand the terrain on google map, including the various locations, communities, landforms, and rivers along/across which the transect line will cross. The coordinates of these locations and the transect points to be examined for digging profile pits and/or auger borings will be inputted into a GPS handset. The â€œGo Toâ€ command of the GPS will then be activated to guide the navigation of the survey team to the point/place of interest on the transect line. Soils with same sequence will be identified as soil associations and labelled as mapping units. The isolated landforms will be traversed to identify the different land facets (i.e., landscape elements) for possible excavation and study in order to establish soilâ€“landscape relationships and identify the unique toposequences associated with them. Representative soil profile pits of dimension 2m x 1.2m x 1.5m will be excavated at each landscape position for detailed morphological description using the FAO 2006 guidelines for soil description. These guidelines for soil description will be transformed into a digital format from which a Kobo Collect app version will be developed and used for field data entry. Soil samples will be collected from each horizon and analysed for physicochemical properties at the ETU-SL soil laboratories following standard analytical procedures. \r\nActivity 2.4. Conduct field trials in strategic locations to collect data for model calibration and evaluation \r\nHere, we will conduct on-farm trials on farmersâ€™ fields in each site under optimal conditions generate data for calibration of DSSATT and APSIM models for various crop varieties to enable us to simulate the performance of these crops in different environments, and to determine farmers\' current crop and nutrient management practices and needs. In addition, multi-locational trials will be conducted in strategic sites in under rainfed conditions to generate data for evaluation of the models for accuracy in the prediction of crop performance under varying management practices. We will compare crop and nutrient management by the farmers and determine where the DSSAT, APSIM, and NuMaSS software and knowledgebase can contribute to improving their cropping systems and soil health. \r\nObjective 3\r\nActivity 3.1. Calibrate, validate models and run simulations to predict performance of crop varieties under changing management practices. \r\nField data collected will be used to calibrate and evaluate the models. Once the models are calibrated and validated with accuracy, we will apply the models to simulate crop performance under changing environments and management practices. \r\nActivity 3.1. Produce simulation maps and graphs. \r\nA digital map of the performance of the crop varieties will be produced and shared with relevant stakeholders such as Farmer-Based Organizations (FBOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Government Agencies, and the private sector.\r\nObjective 4\r\nActivity 4.1. Interpret crop and nutrient simulation results to guide quality decision making and policy planning in climate smart agriculture.\r\nSimulation results of the performance of different crop varieties under changing management practices will be interpreted using standard interpretation keys (SIKs) and the information will be shared with farmers and other relevant stakeholders to enhance their ability to make sound decisions for improved crop productivity.  \r\nActivity 4.2. Assess the level of adoption of the generated knowledge over time.\r\nOur expectation is that there is a continuum of users of the knowledge that would be generated from this project, ranging from farmers at the household level, extension agents at the community and district level, and policy planners and researchers at the regional and national level. For this reason, we will conduct three different tests of adoption. To assess adoption level by farmers, we will generate recommendations for each prediction model under study for a set of farmers in each site, and then survey those farmers and collect extensive data from them about their soil-fertility amendment use. For adoption by extension staff, we will assess whether or not the amounts and kinds of nutrients recommended by the model predictions are appropriate for the farms in the area being studied. We will survey extension agents about what they recommend to farmers regarding their soil-fertility amendments, and correlate predicted recommendations from models with the recommendations of the extension agent. If the model predicted recommendations do not correlate with extension agents\' reported recommendations, then farmer and extension agents will be surveyed to determine whether model predicted recommendations are appropriate and why if not. In the case of adoption by policy planners and researchers, our assumptions are that either more training is necessary and more accurate information needs to flow from researchers to local extension agents and vice-versa, or models do not generate good accurate socioeconomic predictions and need to be refined, for which case we would need to source a new funding.\r\nObjective 5\r\nActivity 5.1. Strengthen the capacity of the Agronomy Department of the Faculty of Development Agriculture and Natural Resources Management. \r\nThere is a long-standing need for human capacity development of staff of the Department of Agronomy in the Faculty of Development Agriculture and Natural Resources Management at the postgraduate level. Presently, only two staff of this department hold a PhD degree. This project will train one additional staff at PhD level. Eventually, the department will be able to enhance its teaching and research capability. Additionally, hands-on training will be organized every year to strengthen the capacity of both field and laboratory technicians of the faculty through short courses, workshops, and seminars. \r\nActivity 5.2. Develop a web database and publish study findings in reputable domains/platforms. \r\nHere, the information generated will be converted into a web database and this will be held on the website of the Directorate of Research and Innovation at the main web portal of the university. In addition, the finding will be presented at ', 'Rural Agricultural Training and Education Programme (RATE P) Project \r\n\r\nThis programme is a public-private partnership project between Bantu Brothers Foundation (BBF), Eastern Technical University of Sierra Leone (ETU-SL) and the Gegeru Community, and is the first private investor, local community and tertiary institution program for Agricultural Development in Eastern Sierra Leone. The program is designed to improve the economic stability of the agricultural industry, help local farmers adjust production to meet demand, and conserve natural resources as well as building both the human and infrastructural capacity of institutions.\r\nThe Bantu Brothers Foundation (BBF) is an agriculturally-oriented organization that administers and manages farm commodity, train, empower and develop communities for sustainable development with the general aim of improving agricultural productivity in Africa and beyond.

It offers a comprehensive solution that can address multiple dimensions of the identified challenges. The use of renewable energy aligns with sustainability goals, community engagement builds a sense of ownership, and private-sector collaboration ensures economic growth. The data-driven aspect guarantees efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\r\n', 'No relevant ongoing research/projects have been identified in Sierra Leone that are directly related to the objectives or scope of this project which integrates initiatives that focus on sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, or community engagement.

Therefore, the set of objectives and the underlying activities are all extremely practical in nature. The activities will use industry standard practices as a guide. This will allow us to achieve positive outcomes and maximize the use of our available resources.\r\nA diagram of the system to be investigated and implemented is shown below \r\n \r\nFigure 1 - LoRaWAN Smart Agriculture Concept Diagram\r\nThe system components are enumerated below:\r\nÂ· LoRaWAN Gateway. This device allows the user to monitor and control the overall system. It could also interface to an internet connection.\r\nÂ· Actuator Node. This device allows the user to control various motors and/or pumps in the system. Motors and pumps control the opening and closing of system irrigation pipelines/hoses. By controlling the state of system flow, water use can be minimized. It could be possible to use actuator nodes to also control fertilizer pumps and sprayers.\r\nÂ· Actuation Device. This could be either a motor to control water flow or a pump to control fertilizer feed rate. Other types of actuation devices are possible in this system.\r\nÂ· Irrigation pipeline/hose. Allows for the flow of water and/or fertilizer to various agricultural plants within the system.\r\nÂ· Sensor Nodes. These devices monitor the environment and provide information about the current soil humidity and pH, indirectly providing information about plant health and viability.  This information can be transmitted back to the gateway periodically. The gateway can then make decisions to actuate various nodes within the system to initialize irrigation and/or fertilizing application.  \r\nThe basic system described above can be expanded using these building blocks. This allows the system to scale as deployment needs dictate.\r\n We propose implementing the above system using a combination of embedded microcontroller modules and custom-designed hardware. Using modules will allow us to leverage current high performance 32-bit microcontrollers, while minimizing the design effort and risk. By designing custom hardware, we can implement solutions tailored to our needs, while also improving our knowledge base.\r\nSignificant work is being done around the world in the design and implementation of efficient, smart agriculture systems.  Our goal is to catapult Sierra Leone to the forefront of technology transformation by improving agricultural production, supporting the governmentâ€™s flagship program -Feed Salone, while aiding technical knowledge transfer and human capital development in embedded systems manufacturing.\r\nOur approach would be to conduct the research using a phased product lifecycle approach in four phases.\r\nThe detailed set of activities (based on industry product design best practices) would be :\r\nPhase 1 - Feasibility Study and Selection of farms	Duration: 1 month\r\nLead by  Principal Investigator, Dr Mohamed Blango with Project team\r\nThe first phase will include an assessment of local farms for technical feasibility and future field tests, focusing on vegetable farms, subsistence farmers and small acreage. The feasibility study will include an evaluation of suitability for the irrigation system, potential product demand and adoption by farmers. This will take about one month and culminate in the selection of specific parameters, indicators, and farms for the research. Proximity to the Njala University campus will be given consideration.\r\nPhase 2 - Prototype development   			 	Duration: 6 - 8 months\r\nLead by Investigator,  Oluwokay Victor Johns with Project team\r\nThis phase will incorporate the following activities based on industry best practices.\r\nâ—	Collect and document hardware and firmware requirements based on application.\r\nâ—	Generate hardware and firmware architecture documents using requirements as input\r\nâ—	Select LoRaWAN modules and associated microcontroller modules that will run the firmware images.\r\nâ—	Generate   prototype hardware design using KiCAD as the design tool\r\nâ—	Implement prototype firmware using dev kits to run initial implementations.\r\nâ—	Provision and commission LoRaWAN nodes using dev kits running developed firmware.\r\nâ—	 Review hardware design schematics internally and with external stakeholders\r\nâ—	Contract PCB layout and send design to external PCB manufacturer for layaout and fabrication.\r\nâ—	Receive and verify populated PCBs.\r\nâ—	Integrate firmware on prototype PCBs\r\nâ—	Provision and commission LoRaWAN nodes on custom prototype hardware\r\nPhase 3 - Field Trials				Duration: 9 months\r\nLead by Investigator, Dominic Ibrahim-Sayo with Project team\r\nThis phase involves running field trials of the application. To carry out field tests, local soil analysis needs to be carried out to determine factors such as infiltration rate and other drainage characteristics. Short duration crops such as cucumber, pepper and cowpea will be cultivated under sprinkler irrigation up to 5 times to have a rich data set. During the field tests, irrigation quality determinants such as irrigation efficiency and distribution uniformity will be investigated in order to assess the effectiveness of the system. A control test will be done prior to the application of the system to ensure effective comparison of the impact. During this phase, we will document field trial results and lessons learned.\r\nPhase 4 - Feedback and testing of market acceptance		Duration: 5 months\r\nBased on the feedback from the field trials and perfection of the LoRaWAN system, the product will be fine tuned and a patent application will be made to ensure protection of Intellectual Property Rights(IPR). Ing. Victor Johns who leads the innovation will take the lead on the patent application. Parameter and data set results will be used to inform the market research on potential customer base for commercialization and future work based on the lessons learned. The results will be peer reviewed and published in a Science and engineering journal to prepare for future work. The results will be used to prepare a full business plan model for commercialization when further funds are available.\r\n', 'N/A', 'No', '', '', 'No', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 1),

One of the major reasons for the decline in production is as result of gummosis disease infestation that is prevalent in sweet orange. Therefore, one of the innovative technology known as artificial vegetative propagation, which refers to the practice of taking a small branch or bud from an established tree of the same family to grow a new specimen will be used. There are many reasons to do this instead of starting from seed: \r\ni.	Propagating citrus trees through grafting and budding allow you to grow the same variety and one that will grow faster than seed. \r\nii.	To preserve the cultivar, or parent treeâ€™s, genetic material so that the second tree is an exact clone.\r\niii.	Grafting/budding helps in solve the problems of major pest and diseases like gummosis which is susceptible to sweet orange but resistant to other citrus species.\r\niv.	Growing a tree from a seed takes too long. Trees grown by propagation reach maturity sooner. This is especially desirable for commercial growers. Propagated trees generally take 2-3 years to mature, while those grown from seed can take 7-15 years.\r\nv.	Growing from seed introduces genetic uncertainty. The new tree may never fruit, or the fruit may be undesirable. \r\nvi.	Grafting/budding allows the tree to take on desirable qualities from a specific rootstock. These include resiliency or smaller tree size. \r\nvii.	Propagation allows you to preserve old varieties. Perhaps a citrus tree is old and frail, but you really like the fruit. Propagate a new tree from its healthy, young growth. \r\nviii.	Grafting/budding allows you to grow multiple citrus varieties on one tree to save space. This is often called a â€œfruit cocktail treeâ€ and is great for people with smaller yards.\r\nBy the end of this project ', 'By the end of this project 140 farmers will be equipped with the knowledge of citrus production with one acre established citrus plantation in 14 districts in Sierra Leone.

ETU-SL will further collaborate with government and non-governmental organizations to ensure scalability and sustainability of this environmentally friendly technology in future programs.', 'By the end of this project, it is hoped that 200 women and youth farmers would have learnt skills to establish and manage a vermicomposting enterprise. It is expected that these project beneficiaries will apply the skills learnt to establish and manage their own vermicomposting enterprises and serve as Trainer of Trainers (ToTs) in their localities. By the end of the project, we are expecting a 25% increase in awareness on the negative effects of inorganic fertilizers, a 25% increase in the use of vermicompost and vermiwash fertilizers by farmers in project communities and its environs, and 25% increase in the number of farmers owning vermicomposting enterprises. Generally, the potential benefits are as follows:\r\ni.	Soil fertility improvement: Vermicompost contains higher percentage of both macro and micronutrients like organic carbon (9.2 â€“ 18%), total Nitrogen (1.5 â€“ 2.1%), total Phosphorus (1.0 â€“ 1.5%), total Potassium (0.6%), available Sulphur (128 â€“ 548 ppm), Calcium and Magnesium (22 â€“ 70 me/100g), Copper (100 ppm), Iron (1800 ppm) and Zinc (50 ppm). It also contains growth promoting hormones, e.g., Auxins and Cytokinins, as well as flowering hormone known as Gebberellins, secreted by earthworms which stimulate shoot and root development. It contains some antibiotics and actinomycetes that help in increasing resistance of crop plants against pest and diseases. Vermicompost also offers high porosity, aeration, drainage and water holding capacity, which are helpful for maintenance of soil health and fertility. On the other hand, vermiwash is very useful as a foliar spray. It is a collection of excretory products and mucus secretion of earthworms along with micronutrients from soil organic molecules that can serve as fertilizer and growth promoter. \r\nii.

Leaders of national treatment programs and frontline healthcare providers have been or will be mapped out as potential collaborators.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will engage with the World Health Organization regarding countriesâ€™ access to support for translation of our findings.\r\n\r\nIf our work is successful, we will work with national treatment programs to have it incorporated into the treatment and prevention guidelines and build a framework for widespread training of frontline healthcare workers ahead of the deployment.', 'The findings of this study will be published in open-access peer-reviewed journals.  We will prepare several educational sessions/talks and social media materials on CPA.  Findings will also be presented at national and international conferences.\r\n\r\nThe timeline for this project will be communicated to all the stakeholders. The project is proposed to start with the finalization and submission of the study protocol to the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in March 2024.  In April 2024, we will recruit and train the research team on the protocol and engage stakeholders in the study. Data collection will start in June 2024 and last for 8 months (until January 2025). We will prepare technical (manuscript) and financial reports and disseminate the findings in April 2025 and August 2025.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 1, 2),

Agriculture consumes a staggering 70 percent of the world\'s freshwater resources, and in many regions, traditional irrigation practices are inefficient, resulting in water wastage. With the global population projected to increase by two billion by 2050, the demand for food will significantly rise, making it impossible to meet these needs through traditional agricultural methods alone. Precision irrigation emerges as a key solution to enhance water efficiency. This innovative approach allows the precise application of water and nutrients directly to the plants at the right time and location, optimizing growing conditions and enabling farmers to achieve higher yields while conserving water resources (&quot;Netafim &ndash; Netafim.com&quot;).\r\n\r\nAnother technological advancement in agriculture, especially in India, is the use of drones for farming. Drones equipped with remote sensing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities are gaining popularity. These technologies enable real-time collection of environmental data, providing farmers with valuable insights for crop management. Whether or not precision agriculture equipment is in use, drone-based aerial intelligence offers various applications for crop monitoring and management, offering the potential to significantly enhance crop output (&quot;ResearchGate&quot;).\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a growing emphasis on automation and robotics in agriculture, which extends to the broader economy. This trend highlights the potential benefits of adopting automation and robotic technologies in agricultural production. These technologies are poised to transform the agriculture sector by improving efficiency and productivity, reducing labor requirements, and streamlining various processes (&quot;Center for Commercial Agriculture&quot;).\r\n\r\nIn addition to technological advancements, gender equality and the empowerment of women in agriculture are of paramount importance. Women comprise approximately 43 percent of the agricultural labor force in developing countries. Research indicates that giving women equal access to productive resources as men could boost farm yields by 20 to 30 percent, ultimately increasing total agricultural output in developing nations by 2.5 to 4 percent. This could lead to a substantial reduction in global hunger rates, with a potential decrease of 12 to 17 percent. Despite their significant roles in agriculture, women often face challenges related to decision-making, resource access, and financial opportunities, hindering their full potential in the sector (&quot;UN Women &ndash; Headquarters&quot;).\r\n\r\nIn this context, innovative technologies and gender-inclusive approaches are essential for addressing the evolving challenges and opportunities in agriculture, water management, and food security.', 'IES-4-2023-0020', 'Yes', '000900076261711X', 'No', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'No', 'USD', NULL, 'No', NULL, 'No', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'No', NULL, 'No', NULL, NULL, NULL),
